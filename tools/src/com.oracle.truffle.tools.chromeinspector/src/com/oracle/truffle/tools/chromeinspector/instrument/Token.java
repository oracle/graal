/**
 * Token encapsulates some sensitive data that can be compared in a secure way. That is, the
 * {@link #equals(Object)} method does not leak any information through timing. While one could be
 * careful with {@link String} or byte[] and perform all the comparisons in a secure way, just one
 * careless call of {@link Object#equals(Object)} could expose the secret data to an attacker. For
 * this reason, we encapsulate it into a class to prevent such accidental exposure.
 *
 * The Token class does not allow the data to be extracted in the original form. It has limited set
 * of operation that allow you to learn something about the data:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Comparison - designed not to leak any data through its execution time.</li>
 * <li>{@link #hashCode()} - this might expose part of the <strong>hash</strong>. Note that some
 * collection implementations like {@link java.util.HashMap} might use it and leak this value
 * through timing attack.</li>
 * <li>{@link #toString()} might contain whole <strong>hash</strong> of the sensitive data.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * At worst, just a hash of the sensitive data can leak by careless operation. If this happens:
 * <ul>
 * <li>All secrets with entropy outside of attacker's capability for offline attacks are safe.</li>
 * <li>Secrets with low entropy (e.g., short secrets or secrets made in a predictable way) might be
 * cracked by a offline attack.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Please note that this class does <strong>not</strong> use a slow hashing function (like bcrypt),
 * that are recommended for secrets of potentially entropy (e.g., passwords). <strong>You should not
 * store low-entropy secrets there unless you are extremely careful about calling methods such as
 * {@link #hashCode()} and {@link #toString()}.</strong>
 *
 * Those operations are explicitly not planned to be ever supported:
 * <ul>
 * <li>serialization - Allowing serialization would not allow us to change the hash function or
 * String encoding in future.</li>
 * <li>comparing values like {@link Comparable#compareTo(Object)} - This could be hardly implemented
 * in a meaningful way without compromising security.</li>
 * </ul>
