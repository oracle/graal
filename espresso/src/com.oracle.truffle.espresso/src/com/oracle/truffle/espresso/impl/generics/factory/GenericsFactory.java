/**
 * This is a modified version of sun.reflect.generics.factory.GenericsFactory. We have replaced Type
 * with EspressoType to represent Espresso guest types.
 * <p>
 * A factory interface for reflective objects representing generic types. Implementors (such as core
 * reflection or JDI, or possibly javadoc will manufacture instances of (potentially) different
 * classes in response to invocations of the methods described here.
 * <p>
 * The intent is that reflective systems use these factories to produce generic type information on
 * demand. Certain components of such reflective systems can be independent of a specific
 * implementation by using this interface. For example, repositories of generic type information are
 * initialized with a factory conforming to this interface, and use it to generate the type
 * information they are required to provide. As a result, such repository code can be shared across
 * different reflective systems.
