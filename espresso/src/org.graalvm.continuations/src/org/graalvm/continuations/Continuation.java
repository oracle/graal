/**
 * <h1>Continuation</h1>
 *
 * <p>
 * A delimited one-shot continuation, which encapsulates a part of the program's execution such that
 * it can be resumed from the point at which it was suspended.
 *
 * <p>
 * Continuations allow you to mark a region of code in which the program can <i>suspend</i>, which
 * passes control flow up the stack to the point at which the continuation was <i>resumed</i>. This
 * implementation is low level and doesn't address common needs, such as passing objects in and out
 * of the continuation as it suspends and resumes.
 *
 * <p>
 * Continuations are not threads. When accessing thread locals they see the values that their
 * hosting thread would see. Continuations are also not thread safe.
 *
 * <p>
 * Exceptions thrown from the entry point propagate out of {@link #resume()} as
 * {@link ContinuationExecutionException} and then mark the continuation as failed. Resuming the
 * continuation after that point will fail with {@link IllegalContinuationStateException}. If you
 * want to retry a failed continuation you must have a clone from before the failure (see note
 * below).
 *
 * <h1>Serialization</h1>
 *
 * <p>
 * Continuations can be serialized to disk and resumed later in a separate process. Alternatively
 * they can be discarded and left for the GC to clean up.
 *
 * <p>
 * Continuation deserialization is <b>not secure</b>. You should only deserialize continuations you
 * yourself suspended, as resuming a malicious continuation can cause arbitrary undefined behaviour,
 * i.e. is equivalent to handing control of the JVM to the attacker.
 *
 * <h2>Java serialization</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * By default, {@link Continuation} supports standard java serialization (i.e. implements
 * {@link Serializable}. This works well only if all that is reachable from the continuation is
 * serializable.
 *
 * <p>
 * For a continuation to be serialized, the given {@link ContinuationEntryPoint} itself must be
 * serializable.
 *
 * <h2>External serialization</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * Given that requiring all reachable objects from the continuation is very restrictive, some users
 * may want to use other serialization frameworks. For that purpose, the class
 * {@link ContinuationSerializable} is provided. See its documentation and its methods'
 * documentation for more details.
 *
 * <h3>Note:</h3>
 * <p>
 * This class implements <i>one shot</i> continuations, meaning you cannot restart a continuation
 * from the same suspend point more than once. For that reason this class is mutable, and the act of
 * calling {@code resume} changes its state. If you want to roll back and retry a resume operation
 * you should start by serializing the continuation, then trying to deserialize it to obtain a new
 * {@code Continuation} that you can resume again. This is required because the continuation may
 * have mutated the heap in arbitrary ways, and so resuming a continuation more than once could
 * cause extremely confusing and apparently 'impossible' states to occur.
