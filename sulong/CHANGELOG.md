# Version 21.2.0

Fixes:

* Fix LLVM toolchain not working correctly for C++ on MacOS 11.3.

* Fix exceptions being swallowed and not printed out on Sulong context disposal.

* Thread return values are now correctly removed from the context when joining the
  respective thread.

New features:

* Support implicitly typed XADD instructions in inline assembly.

* Support some atomic variants of certain inline assembly instructions. Currently
  supported instructions are: xchg, cmpxchg and xadd along with their explicitly typed
  variants, and various unary instructions including incb/w/l/q and decb/w/l/q.

* System calls that return pointers are now supported.

* Support passing pointers as operands to inline assembly instructions.

* Support C++ virtual calls via interop.

# Version 21.1.0

New features:

* Added a sanity check to verify that loaded bitcode files have been compiled correctly.
  If not, a _mismatching target triple_ error is reported. To make this error non-fatal,
  set `--llvm.verifyBitcode=false`. To silence the message, set `--log.llvm.BitcodeVerifier.level=OFF`.

* Allow accessing foreign buffers from LLVM bitcode via the interop buffers API.

* Added intrinsic functions for pthread_setname_np and pthread_getname_np.

* Added intrinsic functions for dlopen and dlsym.

# Version 21.0.0

Fixes:

* Improve AST sharing, and support auxiliary engine caching.
  On top of the regular AST sharing that allows sharing code between multiple contexts in a
  single engine, this allows persisting of the shared code, to share it across process boundaries.

* Add support for MacOS Big Sur.

Deprecations:

* Add deprecation warning for the old header locations `polyglot.h` and `llvm/api/toolchain.h`.
  This header files were deprecated already in 20.3.0, but without a warning.

# Version 20.3.0

New features:

* Introduced [handles API](projects/com.oracle.truffle.llvm.libraries.graalvm.llvm/include/graalvm/llvm/handles.h)
  for storing managed pointers in native memory.

* Enabled AST sharing in the GraalVM LLVM runtime. This allows code of bitcode libraries
  to be shared between multiple contexts within a single engine.

Changes:

* Updated LLVM toolchain to version 10.0.0.

* Improved for `va_list` / varargs handling across language boundaries.
  Using `va_start` in an LLVM function that was called from a foreign language no longer forces
  all arguments into native memory. The resulting `va_list` object can be passed to code written
  in other languages, and accessed there using standard interop APIs.

* Moved `polyglot.h` to `graalvm/llvm/polyglot.h` and `llvm/api/toolchain.h` to `graalvm/llvm/toolchain-api.h`.
  The old header locations are deprecated, and will be removed in a future release.

* Renamed `libpolyglot-mock.so` to `libgraalvm-llvm.so`.
  The old name is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

* Use the version of the LLVM toolchain as the LLVM language version (see `lli --version`).

# Version 20.2.0

New features:

* Support reading multi-byte values from polyglot arrays explicitly typed as i8 arrays.

* Fail when a function is called over interop with fewer arguments than it expects.

* Support `InteropLibrary.isIdentical` and related messages.

* Added the `--print-toolchain-api-identifier`,  `--print-toolchain-api-tool <tool-name>`
  and `--print-toolchain-api-paths <path-name>` arguments to the `lli` launcher.
  These can be used to query the [Toolchain API](docs/contributor/TOOLCHAIN.md)
  from the command line.

* The [Java API of the Toolchain](projects/com.oracle.truffle.llvm.api/src/com/oracle/truffle/llvm/api/Toolchain.java)
  now supports requesting locations via the `#getPaths()` method. For example
  the location of the toolchain executables or libraries. See the JavaDoc for
  more details.

* Added `llvm/api/toolchain.h` header for accessing the [Toolchain](docs/contributor/TOOLCHAIN.md)
  from C code.

Removed:

* Removed the `--llvm.sourcePath` option (deprecated since 19.0), use
  `--inspect.SourcePath` instead.

* Removed support for the application/x-llvm-ir-bitcode-base64 mime-type
  (deprecated since 19.0).

# Version 20.1.0

Changes:

* `libc++` and `libc++abi` are now shipped as bitcode libraries. For building
  those `cmake` is required to be installed.

* C++ support (libsulong++) is no longer loaded by default. Instead, it is
  enabled if `libc++` is loaded. Executables (ELF, Mach-O) compiled with
  the toolchain usually have a dependency on this library and will continue
  to work.  Plain bitcode files, which do not allow to specify dependencies,
  may fail with an error similar to the following:
  ```
  Global variable _ZNSt3__15ctypeIcE2idE is declared but not defined.
  ```
  This can be solved by either compiling it into a proper executable, or by
  specifying the dependency on the command line (e.g., `lli --lib libc++.so.1 ...`
  on Linux or `lli --lib libc++.1.dylib` on macOS).

* Module initialization order is now only based on the dependencies recorded in the
  ELF/Mach-O file instead of looking at imported symbols. Consequently, the order
  plain bitcode files are initialized might change since they do not allow recording
  dependencies. If the initialization order is important, the suggested approach to
  use ELF/Mach-O files. The [Toolchain](docs/contributor/TOOLCHAIN.md) can help creating those.

* Cover more cases when calling functions that receive structs by value across interop
  boundaries.

* Bitcode execution now supports on-stack-replacement of loops, i.e., compiling
  long-running loops before the surrounding function is compiled.

# Version 20.0.0

Changes:

* The [Toolchain](docs/contributor/TOOLCHAIN.md) is now based on LLVM 9.0.0.

New features:

* Support accessing `llvm-ar`, `llvm-nm`, `llvm-objcopy`,
  `llvm-objdump`, `llvm-ranlib`, `llvm-readelf`, `llvm-readobj` and
  `llvm-strip` via the [toolchain](docs/contributor/TOOLCHAIN.md).

# Version 19.3.0

Changes:

* The [Toolchain](docs/contributor/TOOLCHAIN.md) is no longer experimental.

New features:

* Added `mx extract-bitcode` command for extracting embedded bitcode.
  Usage: `mx extract-bitcode inputFile.so outputFile.bc`, where `inputFile` can
  be can be a file of any supported format such as wrapped bitcode or ELF/Mach-O
  with an embedded bitcode sections.

* Added preliminary support for parsing bitcode produced by LLVM 9.

* We are now shipping native `libc++` and `libc++abi` libraries with the LLVM runtime,
  so users no longer need to install them manually.

* We added linker support to the LLVM toolchain. A path to the linker can be requested
  via the `LD` tool name.

* Added the `--print-toolchain-path` command line flag to `lli` to print the location
  of the toolchain on the standard output.

* The toolchain Java API can be used to query the toolchain path using the `PATH` name.

* Added intrinsics for pthread thread management functions.

Improvements:

* Clang and other LLVM tools are no longer required to be installed for building
  the GraalVM LLVM runtime. Instead, the LLVM distribution bundled with the
  [Toolchain](docs/contributor/TOOLCHAIN.md) is used.

# Version 19.2.0

New features:

* Support locating dynamic libraries relatively using (`rpath`).
* Preliminary support for compiling to bitcode using the LLVM toolchain.
  See [docs/contributor/TOOLCHAIN.md](docs/contributor/TOOLCHAIN.md) for more details.
  *WARNING*: The toolchain is experimental. Functionality may be added,
  changed or removed without prior notice.
* Support for simple pointer arithmetics with foreign objects.
  In addition to offset arithmetics, GraalVM now supports "negated" pointers and
  simple bitmask operations (typically used for alignment operations).

Improvements:

* Improved display of pointers to foreign objects in the LLVM debugger.
  When inspecting pointer values that point somewhere inside a foreign object,
  the debugger now allows inspecting the original foreign object, not just the
  contents of the pointer itself.

# Version 19.1.0

Fixes:

* Calling exit(...) in an embedded context is now a catchable PolyglotException.
* Skip source path entries that we're not allowed to access.
  Previously, when running in an embedded context with restricted access to the
  file system, the LLVM engine threw an exception when it could not read the
  source files, even if no debugger was attached. Now it will still run. Only
  when a debugger is attached, an error is reported when the source file can't
  be accessed.

# Version 19.0.0

Changes:

* Moved `polyglot.h` into the `include` subdirectory.
* Remove language version from LLVMLanguage.
  The LLVM engine in GraalVM is always released in sync with GraalVM, no need for
  a separate version number.

Fixes:

* Don't use host interop for LLVM engine internals.
  This means the LLVM engine now works correctly with minimal permissions. In particular,
  the host interop permission is not needed anymore.

New features:

* Preliminary support for bitcode produced by LLVM 8.

# Version 1.0.0 RC14

  as well as bitcode files in an embedded xar archive in the `__bundle` section of
  executables or dylibs.

Changes:

* Update libc++/libc++abi imports to 5.0.2 (no actual code changes).

# Version 1.0.0 RC12

* Expert-level option `--llvm.loadC++Libraries=false` to disable automatic
  loading of C++ standard libraries.

# Version 1.0.0 RC7

New features:

* New polyglot builtin `polyglot_has_member`.

Changes:

* Removed support for implicit polyglot types for local variables
  as the availability of type information is not guaranteed.
  Explicit polyglot casts are now strictly required (`polyglot_as_typed`).
  See [docs/contributor/INTEROP.md](docs/contributor/INTEROP.md) and [polyglot.h](projects/com.oracle.truffle.llvm.libraries.graalvm.llvm/include/polyglot.h)
  for more details.

New features:

* Support for bitcode of LLVM version 6.0.
* New API for accessing polyglot values from C (`polyglot.h`).

Changes:

* The `libc++` dependency is now optional and only required for running C++
  code. `libc++abi` is no longer required.
