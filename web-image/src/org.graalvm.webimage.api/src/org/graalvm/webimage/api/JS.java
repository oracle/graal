/**
 * Replaces the body of a Java method with JavaScript code. The JavaScript code is specified by the
 * {@link #value()} of this annotation. A method with this annotation can be made {@code native},
 * since its Java body is not used at run-time (this is the convention).
 *
 * <b>Examples:</b>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code @JS("console.log('User message: '.concat(message));")}
 * public static native void reportToUser(String message);
 *
 * {@code @JS("return obj.hashCode();")}
 * public static native Integer hashCode(Object obj);
 * </pre>
 *
 * The data types in JavaScript are different from the data types in Java, so this annotation
 * defines a mapping between the Java and the JavaScript data types. The mapping is 1:1, meaning
 * that each Java data type maps to exactly one JavaScript, and vice versa. This mapping determines
 * how Java arguments are converted to JavaScript, and how JavaScript return values are converted
 * back to Java values.
 *
 * The following Java and JavaScript type pairs correspond to each other:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Java {@code null} value and the JavaScript {@code null} value.</li>
 * <li>Java {@link JSUndefined} and JavaScript {@code Undefined}.</li>
 * <li>Java {@link JSBoolean} and JavaScript {@code Boolean}.</li>
 * <li>Java {@link JSNumber} and JavaScript {@code Number}.</li>
 * <li>Java {@link JSBigInt} and JavaScript {@code BigInt}.</li>
 * <li>Java {@link JSString} and JavaScript {@code String}.</li>
 * <li>Java {@link JSSymbol} and JavaScript {@code Symbol}.</li>
 * <li>Java {@link JSObject} and JavaScript {@code Object}.</li>
 * <li>Any other Java class and the corresponding JavaScript {@code Proxy} for that class.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The Java class {@link JSValue} is the common supertype of {@link JSUndefined}, {@link JSBoolean},
 * {@link JSNumber}, {@link JSBigInt}, {@link JSString}, {@link JSSymbol} and {@link JSObject}. It
 * defined conversion methods such as {@link JSValue#asInt()} and {@link JSValue#asString()}, which
 * allow converting certain {@link JSValue} objects to corresponding Java objects (for example,
 * {@link JSNumber} can be converted to most Java numeric types).
 *
 * Other Java classes are transformed to JavaScript {@code Proxy} objects, which expose JavaScript
 * keys that correspond to methods of the underlying Java object. Such an object behaves as if it
 * were a regular JavaScript object, but its internal behavior is defined by the corresponding Java
 * code.

    /**
     * When this annotation is used together with the {@link JS} annotation, the arguments and
     * return values of the respective method undergo implicit Java-to-JavaScript and
     * JavaScript-to-Java conversions.
     *
     * When the {@link JS.Coerce} annotation is present, Java-value arguments to
     * {@link JS}-annotated methods are implicitly converted (coerced) to the corresponding
     * JavaScript type (and more broadly, they are implicitly converted when JavaScript code calls a
     * Java method that has the {@link JS.Coerce} annotation, and that method returns a value).
     * These conversions are done in a way such that no information is dropped -- for example, a
     * Java {@code byte} value is coerced to a JavaScript {@code Number} value, which is a wider
     * type.
     *
     * The following Java types are coerced to JavaScript values as follows:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@code boolean} and {@link java.lang.Boolean} are converted to a JavaScript
     * {@code Boolean}.</li>
     * <li>{@code byte} (and {@link java.lang.Byte}), {@code short} (and {@link java.lang.Short}),
     * {@code char} (and {@link java.lang.Character}), {@code int} (and {@link java.lang.Integer}),
     * {@code float} (and {@link java.lang.Float}), {@code double} (and {@link java.lang.Double}),
     * are converted to a JavaScript {@code Number}.</li>
     * <li>{@code long}, {@link java.lang.Long} and {@link java.math.BigInteger} are converted to a
     * JavaScript {@code BigInt}.</li>
     * <li>{@link java.lang.String} is converted to a JavaScript {@code String}.</li>
     * <li>Any functional-interface object (whose class implements exactly one single abstract
     * method as defined by the {@link java.lang.FunctionalInterface} annotation) is converted to a
     * JavaScript {@code Function}.</li>
     * <li>A primitive array is converted to corresponding JavaScript typed arrays. Concretely, an
     * array of type {@code boolean[]} is converted to a JavaScript {@code Uint8Array}, a
     * {@code byte[]} array to a JavaScript {@code Int8Array}, a {@code short[]} array to a
     * JavaScript {@code Int16Array}, a {@code char[]} array to a JavaScript {@code Uint16Array}, a
     * {@code int[]} array to a JavaScript {@code Int32Array}, a {@code float[]} array to a
     * JavaScript {@code Float32Array}, a {@code long[]} array to a JavaScript
     * {@code BigInt64Array}, and a {@code double[]} array to a JavaScript {@code Float64Array}.
     * </li>
     * <li>All other values are not coerced -- subtypes of the Java {@link JSValue} class are
     * converted to corresponding JavaScript values, and other objects are converted to JavaScript
     * proxies.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * When the {@link JS.Coerce} annotation is present, JavaScript return values of
     * {@link JS}-annotated methods, which originate from JavaScript code, are implicitly converted
     * (coerced) to the corresponding Java values (and more broadly, they are implicitly converted
     * when JavaScript code passes JavaScript arguments to a Java method that has {@link JS.Coerce}
     * annotation). The conversion is driven by the type that Java expects. For example, if the
     * return type of a {@link JS}-annotated method is {@code double}, then a JavaScript
     * {@code Number} will be converted to a {@code double}. If the return type is {@code int}, then
     * the JavaScript {@code Number} will be converted to an {@code int}, even though this may
     * truncate the original JavaScript value. However, only certain JavaScript values can be
     * converted to certain Java types -- for example, a JavaScript {@code String} is not converted
     * to a Java {@code int}, and the attempt to return a JavaScript {@code String} from a
     * {@link JS}-annotated method whose return type is {@code int} will throw a
     * {@link ClassCastException}.
     *
     * The following JavaScript types are coerced to the expected Java types as follows:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>JavaScript {@code Boolean} can be coerced to a Java {@code boolean} and
     * {@link java.lang.Boolean}.</li>
     * <li>JavaScript {@code Number} and {@code BigInt} can be coerced to a Java {@code byte} (and
     * {@link java.lang.Byte}), {@code short} (and {@link java.lang.Short}), {@code char} (and
     * {@link java.lang.Character}), {@code int} (and {@link java.lang.Integer}), {@code long} (and
     * {@link java.lang.Long}), {@code float} (and {@link java.lang.Float}), and {@code double} (and
     * {@link java.lang.Double}), {@link java.math.BigInteger} and
     * {@link java.math.BigDecimal}.</li>
     * <li>JavaScript {@code String} can be coerced to a Java {@link java.lang.String}.</li>
     * <li>JavaScript typed array can be coerced to a corresponding Java primitive array, if there
     * is one. Concretely, a JavaScript {@code UInt8Array} can be coerced to a {@code boolean[]}. A
     * JavaScript {@code Int8Array} can be coerced to a {@code byte[]} array. A JavaScript
     * {@code Int16Array} can be coerced to a {@code short[]}, a {@code Uint16Array} can be coerced
     * to a {@code char[]}, a {@code Int32Array} can be coerced to a {@code int[]}, a
     * {@code Float32Array} can be coerced to a {@code float[]}, a {@code BigInt64Array} can be
     * coerced to a {@code long[]}, and a {@code Float64Array} can be coerced to a
     * {@code double[]}.</li>
     * <li>JavaScript {@code Object} can be coerced to any Java class that is a subclass of
     * {@link JSObject} if that class <i>conforms</i> to that JavaScript object.</li>
     * <li>All other values are not coerced -- they are converted to the corresponding Java
     * {@link JSValue} class, with the exception of JavaScript {@code Proxy} objects that wrap Java
     * objects (those are converted back to the original Java objects). A mismatch with the
     * user-ascribed type will cause a {@link ClassCastException}.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * When an object is mutable, the coercions maintain the property that the state-change in Java
     * is reflected in the corresponding JavaScript object, and vice versa. For immutable objects,
     * the object identity is not preserved when the object is passed from Java to JavaScript and
     * then back again (for example, if Java passes a {@code java.lang.Integer} to JavaScript, and
     * JavaScript returns that object back, the returned integer object may not be reference-equal
     * to the original integer object).
