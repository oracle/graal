 * A key-value store of singleton objects. The registry is populated during native image generation
 * (no changes are allowed at run time); it is queried both during native image generation and at
 * run time. The key is a {@link java.lang.Class class or interface}, the value is an instance that
 * extends that class.
 * <p>
 * When accessing the registry at run time, the key must be a compile time constant. The
 * {@link #lookup} is performed during native image generation, and the resulting value is put into
 * the compiled code as a literal constant. Therefore, the actual map that stores the key-value data
 * is not necessary at run time, and there is no lookup overhead at run time.
 * <p>
 * {@link ImageSingletons} avoids static fields: instead of filling a static field during native
 * image generation and accessing it at run time, the value is put into the {@link ImageSingletons}.
 * Usually, that happens in one of the early initialization methods of a {@link Feature}.
