 * made accessible so that it can be called as a C function using the native ABI.
 * <p>
 * An execution context must be passed as a parameter and can be either an {@link IsolateThread}
 * that is specific to the current thread, or an {@link Isolate} for an isolate in which the current
 * thread is attached. These pointers can be obtained via the methods of {@link CurrentIsolate}.
 * When there is more than one parameter of these types, exactly one of the parameters must be
 * annotated with {@link IsolateThreadContext} for {@link IsolateThread}, or {@link IsolateContext}
 * for {@link Isolate}.
 * <p>
 * Exceptions cannot be thrown to the caller and must be explicitly caught in the entry point
 * method. Any uncaught exception causes the termination of the process after it is printed.
 * <p>
 * No object types are permitted for parameters or return types; only primitive Java values,
 * {@link WordBase word} values, and enum values are allowed. Enum values are automatically
 * converted from integer constants to Java enum object constants. The enum class must have a
 * {@link CEnum} annotation. When enum values are passed as parameters, the enum class must have a
 * method with a {@link CEnumLookup} annotation. For enum return types, the enum class must have a
 * method that is annotated with {@link CEnumValue}.
