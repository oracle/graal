/**
 * Denotes a method as a bitfield access of a {@link CStruct C struct}.
 * <p>
 * If the method has a non-void return type, it is a get-method of the field. Calls of the method
 * are replaced with a memory read. The possible signatures are
 * {@code FieldType getFieldName([LocationIdentity locationIdentity]);}
 * <p>
 * If the method has the return type void, it is a set-method of the field. Calls of the method are
 * replaced with memory accesses. The possible signatures are
 * {@code void setFieldName(FieldType value, [LocationIdentity locationIdentity]);} Most
 * architectures do not provide write instructions on the bit-level. Therefore, the memory write of
 * the new value is preceded by a memory read of the old value. This makes bitfield writes
 * non-atomic.
 * <p>
 * The receiver is the pointer to the struct that is accessed, i.e., the base address of the memory
 * access.
 * <p>
 * The {@code FieldType} must be a primitive integer type or a {@link WordBase word type}.
 * <p>
 * The optional parameter {@code locationIdentity} specifies the {@link LocationIdentity} to be used
 * for the memory access. Two memory accesses with two different location identities are guaranteed
 * to not alias. Note that {@link UniqueLocationIdentity} annotation, cannot be used on bitfields.
 * <p>
 * Multiple accessor methods, with different signatures according to the rules of allowed
 * signatures, are allowed for a single field.
