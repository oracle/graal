/**
 * Denotes Java interface that imports a C struct. The interface must extend {@link PointerBase},
 * i.e., it is a word type. There is never a Java class that implements the interface.
 * <p>
 * Field accesses are done via interface methods that are annotated with {@link CField},
 * {@link CFieldAddress}, or {@link CFieldOffset}. All calls of the interface methods are replaced
 * with the appropriate memory or address arithmetic operations. Here is an example to define a
 * complex number structure:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;CStruct
 * interface ComplexValue extends PointerBase {
 *     &#64;CField("re")
 *     double realPart();
 *
 *     &#64;CField("re")
 *     void realPart(double re);
 *
 *     &#64;CField("im")
 *     double imagineryPart();
 *
 *     &#64;CField("im")
 *     void imagineryPart(double im);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The annotated interface, or an outer class that contains the interface, must be annotated with
 * {@link CContext}. Allocate an instances of the {@code struct} either by
 * {@link org.graalvm.nativeimage.StackValue#get(java.lang.Class)} or by
 * {@link org.graalvm.nativeimage.UnmanagedMemory#malloc(org.graalvm.word.UnsignedWord)}.
 *
 * To access an array of structs one can define a special {@code addressOf} method:
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;CStruct("int_double")
 * interface IntOrDouble extends PointerBase {
 *     // allows access to individual structs in an array
 *     IntOrDouble addressOf(int index);
 *
 *     &#64;CField
 *     int i();
 *
 *     &#64;CField
 *     void i(int i);
 *
 *     &#64;CField
 *     double d();
 *
 *     &#64;CField
 *     void d(double d);
 *
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Implementation of such method then allows one to do <em>array arithmetics</em> - e.g. obtain
 * pointer to the first element of the array and then access the others:
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * private static double acceptIntIntDouble(IntOrDouble arr) {
 *     IntOrDouble firstInt = arr.addressOf(0);
 *     IntOrDouble secondInt = arr.addressOf(1);
 *     IntOrDouble thirdDouble = arr.addressOf(2);
 *     return firstInt.i() + secondInt.i() + thirdDouble.d();
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @since 19.0
 * @see org.graalvm.nativeimage.StackValue
 * @see org.graalvm.nativeimage.UnmanagedMemory
