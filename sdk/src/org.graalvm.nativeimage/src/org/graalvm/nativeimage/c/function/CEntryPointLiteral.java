/**
 * A function pointer to an {@link CEntryPoint entry point method} that can be, for example, handed
 * out to C code so that C code can call back into Java code. The method that is referred to must be
 * annotated with {@link CEntryPoint}, which imposes certain restrictions.
 * <p>
 * The actual value of the function pointer is only available at run time. To prevent accidental
 * access to it during native image generation, the actual {@link #getFunctionPointer() function
 * pointer} is encapsulated in this class. The call to {@link #getFunctionPointer()} fails with an
 * exception during native image generation.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class can only be created during native image generation. It is not possible to
 * look up a function by name at run time. The intended use case is therefore as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Function that is externally accessible
 * &#064;CEntryPoint
 * static int myFunction(IsolateThread thread, int x, int y) {
 *     ...
 * }
 *
 * // Invocation interface (for calls from Java, otherwise CFunctionPointer suffices)
 * interface MyFunctionPointer extends CFunctionPointer {
 *     &#064;InvokeCFunctionPointer
 *     int invoke(IsolateThread thread, int x, int y);
 * }
 *
 * // Function pointer literal
 * public static final CEntryPointLiteral&lt;MyFunctionPointer&gt; myFunctionLiteral = CEntryPointLiteral.create(MyClass.class, &quot;myFunction&quot;, new Class&lt;?&gt;[]{IsolateThread.class, int.class, int.class});
 *
 * // Call from Java
 * void caller() {
 *     MyFunctionPointer fp = myFunctionLiteral.getFunctionPointer(); // entry point, could be returned to C code
 *     int fiftyeight = fp.invoke(CurrentIsolate.getCurrentThread(), 47, 11);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
