     * binary is built with {@code -H:+SupportRecurringCallback}. Note that only carefully crafted,

     * easily results in deadlocks, crashes, and difficult-to-debug anomalies.

     * different interval (or none at all). No guarantees are made about the actual interval. For
     * example, when the thread is waiting for a lock or executing native code, no callback can be
     * done.
     * <p>
     * Exceptions that are thrown during the execution of the callback and that are not caught in
     * the callback are ignored. {@link RecurringCallbackAccess#throwException} can be used to
     * explicitly throw an exception that is not ignored.
     * <p>
     * Specifying {@code null} for {@code callback} clears the current thread's callback (in which
     * case, the values of {@code interval} and {@code unit} are ignored).
