 * Features allow clients to intercept the native image generation and run custom initialization
 * code at various stages. All code within feature classes is executed during native image
 * generation, and never at run time.
 * <p>
 * Features have several advantages over static class initializers (which also run during native
 * image generation):
 * <ul>
 * <li>The different feature methods are called at different stages during native image generation,
 * which gives clients control over when code is executed.
 * <li>Feature methods have an {@code access} parameter that allows callbacks into the native image
 * generator.
 * <li>Feature methods run when the {@link ImageSingletons} is already set up, which allows features
 * to prepare data structures that are then used at run time by querying the {@link ImageSingletons}
 * .
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Implementation classes must have a no-argument constructor, which is used to instantiate a
 * singleton instance for each feature using reflection. The following features are included during
 * native image generation:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Features explicitly specified on the command line.</li>
 * <li>Features referenced as {@link #getRequiredFeatures() required} by another included feature.
 * Required features are added transitively, and initialization methods of required features are
 * called after invoking the constructor and {@link #isInConfiguration} of the requiring features
 * (unless the feature dependencies are cyclic).
