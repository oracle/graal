/**
 * A transformer for a field value that can be registered using
 * {@link BeforeAnalysisAccess#registerFieldValueTransformer}.
 * <p>
 * At image build time, the field value transformer provides the value of the field for the image
 * heap. Without a transformer, the value of the field in the image heap is the same as the hosted
 * value in the image generator. A field value transformer allows to intercept the value. A field
 * value transformer can, for example, reset a field to the default null/0 value, replace a filled
 * collection with a new empty collection, or provide any kind of new value for a field.
 * <p>
 * Only one field value transformer can be registered for each field.
 * <p>
 * A field value transformer can be registered for fields of classes that are initialized at image
 * run time. That allows constant folding of final fields even though the declaring class is not
 * initialized at image build time.
 * <p>
 * A field value transformer must be registered before the field is seen as reachable by the static
 * analysis. It is generally safe to register a transformer in {@link Feature#beforeAnalysis} before
 * the static analysis is started, in a {@link BeforeAnalysisAccess#registerReachabilityHandler type
 * reachability handler} for the declaring class of the field, or a
 * {@link BeforeAnalysisAccess#registerSubtypeReachabilityHandler subtype reachability handler} for
 * a super-type of the declaring class of the field.
