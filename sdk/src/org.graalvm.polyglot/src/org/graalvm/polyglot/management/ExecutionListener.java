/**
 * Execution listeners allow to instrument the execution of guest languages. For example, it is
 * possible to attach an execution listeners that is invoked for every statement of the guest
 * language program, similar to how a debugger would single-step through the program.
 * <p>
 * The following example prints the characters of every executed statement of simple JavaScript
 * loop.
 *
 * <code>
 * <pre>
 * Context context = Context.create("js");
 * ExecutionListeners listener = ExecutionListeners.newBuilder()
 *          .onEnter((e) -> System.out.println(
 *                  e.getLocation().getCharacters()))
 *          .statements(true)
 *          .attach(context.getEngine());
 * context.eval("js", "for (var i = 0; i < 2; i++);");
 * listener.close();
 * </pre>
 * </code>
 *
 * Prints the following result:
 *
 * <pre>
 * i = 0
 * i < 2
 * i++
 * i < 2
 * i++
 * i < 2
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Creation and Closing</h3>
 *
 * An execution listener builder can be created by first invoking {@link #newBuilder()}. At least
 * one event consumer and one filtered source element needs to be enabled. To complete the listener
 * attachment {@link Builder#attach(Engine)} needs to be invoked. {@link Builder#attach(Engine)
 * Attach} may be invoked multiple times for one builder.
 * <p>
 * All execution listeners are automatically closed when the engine {@link Engine#close() closed}.
 * To close a listener earlier {@link #close()} may be invoked. Execution listeners are
 * {@link AutoCloseable} and can therefore be used in try-with-resources blocks.
 *
 * <h3>Event Consumers</h3>
 *
 * The following event consumers can be set for an execution listener:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Builder#onEnter(Consumer) OnEnter}: An event that is notified when an execution of an
 * element is entered. This event is consumed before any input values are executed.
 * <li>{@link Builder#onReturn(Consumer) OnReturn}: An event that is notified when an execution of
 * an element was entered and completed.
 * </ul>
 * At least one event consumer needs to be set otherwise an {@link IllegalArgumentException} will be
 * thrown by the builder when it is {@link Builder#attach(Engine) attached}.
 * <p>
 * Event consumers may throw any Java host exception. Such exceptions will be reported to the
 * context as {@link PolyglotException} instances. The thrown exception may be accessed using
 * {@link PolyglotException#asHostException()}.
 *
 * <h3>Event Data</h3>
 *
 * For every event that is consumed the {@link ExecutionEvent#getLocation() source location} and
 * {@link ExecutionEvent#getRootName() root name} data is available. Other event data will return
 * <code>null</code> by default.
 * <p>
 * The collection of the following event data may be enabled:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Builder#collectReturnValue(boolean) Return values}: Enables access to
 * {@link ExecutionEvent#getReturnValue() return values} in {@link Builder#onReturn(Consumer)
 * OnReturn} events.
 * <li>{@link Builder#collectInputValues(boolean) Input values}: Enables access to
 * {@link ExecutionEvent#getInputValues() input values} in {@link Builder#onReturn(Consumer)
 * OnReturn} events.
 * <li>{@link Builder#collectExceptions(boolean) Errors}: Enables access to
 * {@link ExecutionEvent#getException() errors} in {@link Builder#onReturn(Consumer) OnReturn}
 * events.
 * </ul>
 * If additional event data is collected then the peak performance overhead of execution listeners
 * is significant. It is not recommended to collect additional event data when running production
 * workloads.
 * <p>
 * Provided event instances may escape the event consumer and remain usable until the engine is
 * closed.
 *
 * <h3>Event Filters</h3>
 *
 * Execution listeners can be applied to the following source elements:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Builder#roots(boolean) Roots}: Filter for marked program locations that represent a
 * root of a function, method or closure.
 * <li>{@link Builder#statements(boolean) Statements}: Filter for marked program locations that
 * represent a statement.
 * <li>{@link Builder#expressions(boolean) Expressions}: Filter for marked program locations that
 * represent an expression.
 * </ul>
 * At least one source element needs to be enabled otherwise an {@link IllegalArgumentException}
 * will be thrown by the builder when it is {@link Builder#attach(Engine) attached}. Not all source
 * elements may be supported by a language. If the language does not support listening to a source
 * element then no events will be triggered.
 * <p>
 * If multiple source elements are enabled, multiple or one event may be reported per source
 * location. If this behavior is not desirable than multiple execution listeners for each source
 * element can be created and attached.
 * <p>
 * By default the execution listener is applied to all {@link Source sources} that were loaded. A
 * {@link Builder#sourceFilter(Predicate) source filter} may be attached to limit the number of
 * sources that will trigger events.
 *
 * <h3>Performance</h3>
 *
 * The peak performance overhead of execution listeners depend on the granularity of the filter.
 * Roots can be collected more efficiently than statement or expression events due to their
 * frequency. If additional event data is collected then the peak performance overhead of execution
 * listeners is significant. It is not recommended to collect additional event data when running
 * production workloads.
 * <p>
 * {@link Builder#attach(Engine) Attaching} and {@link #close() closing} execution listeners are
 * expensive operations and typically require to traverse through all loaded code. Code that was
 * previously optimized will be deoptimized in the process. It is most efficient to attach an
 * execution listener before any code is executed and let execution listeners automatically close
 * with the engine.
 *
 * <h3>Compatibility</h3>
 *
 * Event execution order and granularity of events are language specific and may change without
 * notice. There are no compatibility guarantees for that provided by the polyglot SDK. Certain
 * language implementations may do so. Please see the language implementation documentation for
 * further details.
 *
 * <h3>Use-cases</h3>
 *
 * Execution listeners are designed as simple API for polyglot embedders to capture cross cutting
 * concerns of the execution of programs. For example, it can be used to count all statements
 * executed in order to detect potentially malicious code. It is not designed to be an API for
 * implementing fully fledged tools. The
 * <a href="http://www.graalvm.org/docs/graalvm-as-a-platform/implement-instrument/">Truffle
 * instrumentation framework</a> should be used for that purpose instead.
