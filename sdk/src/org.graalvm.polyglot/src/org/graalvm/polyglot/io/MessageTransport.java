 * a server endpoint, it calls the {@link MessageTransport#open(URI, MessageEndpoint)} method with
 * the server URI. Usage example:

 * <pre>
 * class RoutedServer implements MessageEndpoint {

 *             try {

 *

 *     public void sendText(String text) throws IOException {

 *     public void sendBinary(ByteBuffer data) throws IOException {
 *         routerOutChannel.write(data);
 *         routerOut.flush();
 *     }
 *

 *     public void sendPing(ByteBuffer data) throws IOException {
 *         remoteEndpoint.sendPong(data);
 *     }

 *     }
 * }

 *                     } else if (routedURI.equals(uri)) {
