fails:Unconditional operator assignment 'var op= expr' is equivalent to 'var = var op expr'
fails:Unconditional operator assignment 'obj.meth op= expr' is equivalent to 'obj.meth = obj.meth op expr'
fails:Conditional operator assignment 'obj.meth op= expr' is equivalent to 'obj.meth op obj.meth = expr'
fails:Conditional operator assignment 'obj.meth op= expr' may not assign at all, depending on the truthiness of lhs
