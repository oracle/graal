/**
 * Implementors of this interface are able to place its last instruction into the delay slot of a
 * {@link SPARCDelayedControlTransfer} instruction.
 *
 * The implementor has to do following steps to emit code into the delay slot for the
 * DelayedControlTransfer instruction:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Emit everything up to the second last instruction.</li>
 * <li>Call
 * {@link SPARCDelayedControlTransfer#emitControlTransfer(com.oracle.graal.lir.asm.CompilationResultBuilder, com.oracle.graal.asm.sparc.SPARCMacroAssembler)}
 * to let the DelayedControlTransfer instruction emit its own code (But must not stuff the delay
 * slot with Nop)</li>
 * <li>emit the last instruction for this {@link LIRInstruction}</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Note: If this instruction decides not to use the delay slot, it can skip the call of
 * {@link SPARCDelayedControlTransfer#emitControlTransfer(com.oracle.graal.lir.asm.CompilationResultBuilder, com.oracle.graal.asm.sparc.SPARCMacroAssembler)}
 * . The DelayedControlTransfer instruction will emit the code just with Nop in the delay slot.
