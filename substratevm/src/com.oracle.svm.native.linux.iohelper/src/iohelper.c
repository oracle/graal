  // All file descriptors that are opened in the Java process and not
  // specifically destined for a subprocess should have the close-on-exec
  // flag set.  If we don't set it, then careless 3rd party native code
  // might fork and exec without closing all appropriate file descriptors
  // (e.g. as we do in closeDescriptors in UNIXProcess.c), and this in
  // turn might:
  //
  // - cause end-of-file to fail to be detected on some file
  //   descriptors, resulting in mysterious hangs, or
  //
  // - might cause an fopen in the subprocess to fail on a system
  //   suffering from bug 1085341.
  //
  // (Yes, the default setting of the close-on-exec flag is a Unix
  // design flaw)
  //
  // See:
  // 1085341: 32-bit stdio routines should support file descriptors >255
  // 4843136: (process) pipe file descriptor from Runtime.exec not being closed
  // 6339493: (process) Runtime.exec does not close all file descriptors on Solaris 9

  // O_CLOEXEC is preferable to using FD_CLOEXEC on an open file descriptor
  // because it saves a system call and removes a small window where the flag
  // is unset.  On ancient Linux kernels the O_CLOEXEC flag will be ignored
  // and we fall back to using FD_CLOEXEC (see below).
