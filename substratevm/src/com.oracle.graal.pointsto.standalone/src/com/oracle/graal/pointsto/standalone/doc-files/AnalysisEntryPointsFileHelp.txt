Use a file to specify the analysis entry point methods. These methods will be added as root methods for analysis besides
the main entry method (if set). At least one of this option and the main entry method must be set.
Each line of the file represents an entry point method. See MethodFilter option for method format details.
To specify a class initialization method, using <clinit> as the method name. E.g. C.<clinit> matches Class C's initialization
method.
Notice:
Although this option allows to specify any method, only direct methods can work as expected. Virtual call need allocation
information to bound to the actual implementations. But the allocation may be missed when the virtual call is the entry point.
