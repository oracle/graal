Use a file to specify the analysis entry point methods. These methods will be added as root methods for analysis besides
the main entry method (if set). At least one of this option and the main entry method must be set.
Each line of the file represents an entry point method, and can optionally specify where the method is located. The line
format is:
  method[:location]
The method should follow the MethodFilter's format, please refer the help for -H:MethodFilter option for details.
The location is where the method's declaring class is located in the analysis target class path. It should be a path of
directory or jar file specified for -H:AnalysisTargetAppCP option. In other words, the location must have been set for
-H:AnalysisTargetAppCP. This location is used to find the method's declaring class from file system when necessary.

Special Cases:
Class initialization method: Use <clinit> as the method name to set class initializer as entry point.
E.g. C.<clinit> matches Class C's initialization method.
Methods in fatjar: Use ! to separate the fatjar itself and the jar inside in the location. For example. C.foo:/home/a.jar!/lib/b.jar.
Methods in abstract classes: entry point method can be a non-abstract method in abstract class and default method in interface.
