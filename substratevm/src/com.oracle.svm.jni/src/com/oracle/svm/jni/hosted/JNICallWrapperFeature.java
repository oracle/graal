/**
 * Responsible for generating JNI call wrappers for Java-to-native and native-to-Java invocations.
 *
 * <p>
 * Java-to-native call wrappers are created by {@link JNINativeCallWrapperSubstitutionProcessor}. It
 * creates a {@link JNINativeCallWrapperMethod} for each Java method that is declared with the
 * {@code native} keyword and that was registered via {@link JNIRuntimeAccess} to be accessible via
 * JNI at runtime. The method provides a graph that performs the native code invocation. This graph
 * is visible to the analysis.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Native-to-Java call wrappers are generated as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link JNIAccessFeature} creates a {@link JNIJavaCallWrapperMethod} for each method that is
 * callable from JNI, associates it with its corresponding {@link JNIAccessibleMethod}, and
 * registers it as an entry point. The method provides a graph that performs the Java method
 * invocation from native code and that is visible to the analysis.</li>
 * <li>Because all {@link JNIJavaCallWrapperMethod call wrappers} are entry points, the call
 * wrappers and any code that is reachable through them is compiled.</li>
 * <li>Before compilation, a {@link CFunctionPointer} is created for each call wrapper that is
 * eventually filled with the call wrapper's final entry point address.</li>
 * <li>Looking up a Java method via JNI finds its {@link JNIAccessibleMethod}, reads its call
 * wrapper's entry address from the {@link CFunctionPointer}, and returns it as the jmethodID. The
 * JNI functions for calling methods, named
 * {@code Call[Static?][ReturnType]Method(env, obj, jmethodID)} only perform a jump to the provided
 * jmethodID argument, and the call wrapper code takes over execution.</li>
 * </ol>
