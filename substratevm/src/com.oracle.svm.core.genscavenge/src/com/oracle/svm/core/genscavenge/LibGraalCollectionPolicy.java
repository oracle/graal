/**
 * A libgraal specific garbage collection policy that responds to GC hints and aggressively
 * expands/shrinks the eden space. It also limits the maximum heap size to 16G as the SVM Serial GC
 * can hit a fatal error if it fails to allocate memory or address space (when compressed references
 * are enabled) during a GC (GR-47622). By restricting the heap to 16G, the latter problem can be
 * avoided. Running out of OS memory will almost certainly cause HotSpot to exit anyway so there
 * less concern about defending against that. It's also expected that 16G is a reasonable limit for
 * a libgraal JIT compilation.
