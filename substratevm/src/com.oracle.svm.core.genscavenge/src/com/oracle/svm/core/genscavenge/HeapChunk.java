/**
 * The common structure of the chunks of memory which make up the heap. HeapChunks are aggregated
 * into {@linkplain Space spaces}. A specific "subtype" of chunk should be accessed via its own
 * accessor class, such as {@link AlignedHeapChunk}, which provides methods that are specific to the
 * type of chunk and its layout. (Such classes intentionally do not subclass {@link HeapChunk} so to
 * not directly expose its methods.)
 * <p>
 * A HeapChunk is raw memory with a {@linkplain Header} on the beginning that stores bookkeeping
 * information about the HeapChunk. HeapChunks do not have any instance methods: instead they have
 * static methods that take the HeapChunk.Header as a parameter.
 * <p>
 * HeapChunks maintain offsets of the current allocation point (top) with them, and the limit (end)
 * where Objects can be allocated. Subclasses of HeapChunks can add additional fields as needed.
 * <p>
 * HeapChunks maintain some fields that would otherwise have to be maintained in per-HeapChunk
 * memory by the Space that contains them. For example, the fields for linking lists of HeapChunks
 * in a Space is kept in each HeapChunk rather than in some storage outside the HeapChunk.
 * <p>
 * For fields that are maintained as more-specifically-typed offsets by leaf "sub-classes",
 * HeapChunk defines the generic (Pointer) "get" methods, and only the "sub-classes" define "set"
 * methods that store more-specifically-typed Pointers, for type safety.
 * <p>
 * In addition to the declared fields of a HeapChunk.Header, for example, a subtype keeps a card
 * table for the write barrier, but because they are variable-sized, rather than declaring field in
 * the Header, static methods are used to compute Pointers to those "fields".
 * <p>
 * HeapChunks are *not* examined for interior Object references by the collector, though the Objects
 * allocated within the HeapChunk are examined by the collector.
