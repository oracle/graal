Require types to be fully defined at image build-time. If used without args, all classes in scope of the option are required to be fully defined.

Using --link-at-build-time without arguments is only allowed on command line or when embedded in a
native-image.properties file of some zip/jar file on the module-path (but not on class-path).

In the module path case, the option will cause all classes of the module to be required to be
fully defined at image build-time. If used without arguments on command line all classes are
required to be fully defined at image build-time.

Using --link-at-build-time with arguments is allowed in every scope:

  1. On command line
  2. Embedded in a native-image.properties file of some zip/jar file on module-path
  3. Embedded in a native-image.properties file of some zip/jar file on class-path

If the option is embedded in native-image.properties file in some zip/jar file all class-names
and package-names passed to the option have to be found in the zip/jar files the option is embedded
in. Using --link-at-build-time with arguments on command line does not have that restriction.
