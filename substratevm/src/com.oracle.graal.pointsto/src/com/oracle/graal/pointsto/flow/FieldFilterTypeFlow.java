/**
 * The field filter flow is used for unsafe writes to fields. An unsafe write to an object can write
 * to any of the unsafe accessed fields of that object, however the written values may not be
 * compatible with all the fields. Thus the written values need to be filtered using the field
 * FieldFilterTypeFlow type. The FieldFilterTypeFlow is a simplified version of FilterTypeFlow in
 * that it is 'not-exact', i.e., it allows types of that are sub-types of the field declared type,
 * it is always 'assignable', i.e., it allows types that are assignable to the field declared type,
 * and it 'includes-null', i.e., it allows null values to pass through. However it's 'source' is an
 * AnalysisField and not a ValueNode, thus it's a completely different class.
