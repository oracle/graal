/**
 * The frozen field filter flow is used for unsafe writes to frozen type state fields. An unsafe
 * write to an object can write to any of the unsafe accessed fields of that object, however the
 * written values may not be compatible with all the fields. Thus the written values need to be
 * filtered using the field FrozenFieldFilterTypeFlow type. The FrozenFieldFilterTypeFlow is a
 * simplified version of FilterTypeFlow in that it is 'not-exact', i.e., it allows types of that are
 * sub-types of the field declared type, it is always 'assignable', i.e., it allows types that are
 * assignable to the field declared type, and it 'includes-null', i.e., it allows null values to
 * pass through. However it's 'source' is an AnalysisField and not a ValueNode, thus it's a
 * completely different class. The difference between this and The FieldFilterTypeFlow is that this
 * one filters on the types reachable through normal writes only and not by the declared type.
