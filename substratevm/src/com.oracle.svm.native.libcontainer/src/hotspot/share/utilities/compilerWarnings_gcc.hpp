// This macro is used by the NORETURN variants of FORBID_C_FUNCTION.
//
// The [[noreturn]] attribute requires that the first declaration of a
// function has it if any have it.
//
// gcc, clang, and MSVC all provide compiler-specific alternatives to that
// attribute: __attribute__((noreturn)) for gcc and clang,
// __declspec(noreturn) for MSVC and clang. gcc and MSVC treat their
// respective compiler-specific alternatives as satisfying that requirement.
// clang does not.
//
// So clang warns if we use [[noreturn]] in the forbidding declaration and the
// library header has already been included and uses the compiler-specific
// attribute. Similarly, clang warns if we use the compiler-specific attribute
// while the library uses [[noreturn]] and the library header is included
// after the forbidding declaration.
//
// For now, we're only going to worry about the standard library, and not
// noreturn functions in some other library that we might want to forbid in
// the future.  If there's more than one library to be accounted for, then
// things may get more complicated.
//
// There are several ways we could deal with this.
//
// Probably the most robust is to use the same style of noreturn attribute as
// is used by the library providing the function.  That way it doesn't matter
// in which order the inclusion of the library header and the forbidding are
// performed.  We could use configure to determine which to use and provide a
// macro to select on here.
//
// Another approach is to always use __attribute__ noreturn in the forbidding
// declaration, but ensure the relevant library header has been included
// before the forbidding declaration.  Since there are currently only a couple
// of affected functions, this is easier to implement.  So this is the
// approach being taken for now.
//
// clang's failure to treat the compiler-specific form as counting toward the
// [[noreturn]] requirement is arguably a clang bug.

// that combination.  Other build combinations should provide sufficient
// coverage.

// clang's warning in this case is arguably a clang bug.
