Non-standard options help:

    --exclude-config      exclude configuration for a space-separated pair of classpath/modulepath
                          pattern and resource pattern. For example:
                          '--exclude-config foo.jar META-INF\/native-image\/.*.properties'
                          ignores all .properties files in 'META-INF/native-image' in all
                          JARs named 'foo.jar'.
    --expert-options      lists image build options for experts
    --expert-options-all  lists all image build options for experts (use at your own risk).
                          Options marked with [Extra help available] contain help that can be

                          displays all available help for a comma-separated list of option names.

    --configurations-path <search path of option-configuration directories>
                          A %pathsep% separated list of directories to be treated as
                          option-configuration directories.
    --debug-attach[=<port or host:port (* can be used as host meaning bind to all interfaces)>]
                          attach to debugger during image building (default port is 8000)
    --diagnostics-mode    Enables logging of image-build information to a diagnostics folder.
    --dry-run             output the command line that would be used for building

    --bundle-create[=new-bundle.nib][,dry-run][,container[=<container-tool>][,dockerfile=<Dockerfile>]]
                          in addition to image building, create a Native Image bundle file (*.nib
                          file) that allows rebuilding of that image again at a later point. If a
                          bundle-file gets passed, the bundle will be created with the given
                          name. Otherwise, the bundle-file name is derived from the image name.
                          Note both bundle options can be extended with ",dry-run" and ",container"
                          * 'dry-run': only perform the bundle operations without any actual image building.
                          * 'container': sets up a container image for image building and performs image building
                            from inside that container. Requires podman or rootless docker to be installed.
                            If available, 'podman' is preferred and rootless 'docker' is the fallback. Specifying
                            one or the other as '=<container-tool>' forces the use of a specific tool.
                          * 'dockerfile=<Dockerfile>': Use a user provided 'Dockerfile' instead of the default based on
                            Oracle Linux 8 base images for GraalVM (see https://github.com/graalvm/container)
    --bundle-apply=some-bundle.nib[,dry-run][,container[=<container-tool>][,dockerfile=<Dockerfile>]]
                          an image will be built from the given bundle file with the exact same
                          arguments and files that have been passed to native-image originally
                          to create the bundle. Note that if an extra --bundle-create gets passed
                          after --bundle-apply, a new bundle will be written based on the given
                          bundle args plus any additional arguments that haven been passed
                          afterwards. For example:
                          > native-image --bundle-apply=app.nib --bundle-create=app_dbg.nib -g
                          creates a new bundle app_dbg.nib based on the given app.nib bundle.
                          Both bundles are the same except the new one also uses the -g option.

    -E<env-var-key>[=<env-var-value>]
                          allow native-image to access the given environment variable during
                          image build. If the optional <env-var-value> is not given, the value
                          of the environment variable will be taken from the environment
                          native-image was invoked from.

    -V<key>=<value>       provide values for placeholders in native-image.properties files
