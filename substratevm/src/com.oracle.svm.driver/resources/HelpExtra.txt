Non-standard options help:

    --expert-options      lists image build options for experts
    --expert-options-all  lists all image build options for experts (use at your own risk).
                          Options marked with [Extra help available] contain help that can be
                          shown with --expert-options-detail
    --expert-options-detail
                          displays all available help for a comma-separated list of option names.
                          Pass * to show extra help for all options that contain it.

    --configurations-path <search path of option-configuration directories>
                          A %pathsep% separated list of directories to be treated as
                          option-configuration directories.
    --debug-attach[=<port or host:port (* can be used as host meaning bind to all interfaces)>]
                          attach to debugger during image building (default port is 8000)
    --diagnostics-mode    Enables logging of image-build information to a diagnostics folder.
    --dry-run             output the command line that would be used for building

    --bundle-create[=new-bundle.nib]
                          in addition to image building, create a Native Image bundle file (*.nib
                          file) that allows rebuilding of that image again at a later point. If a
                          bundle-file gets passed, the bundle will be created with the given
                          name. Otherwise, the bundle-file name is derived from the image name.
                          Note both bundle options can be combined with --dry-run to only perform
                          the bundle operations without any actual image building.
    --bundle-apply=some-bundle.nib
                          an image will be built from the given bundle file with the exact same
                          arguments and files that have been passed to native-image originally
                          to create the bundle. Note that if an extra --bundle-create gets passed
                          after --bundle-apply, a new bundle will be written based on the given
                          bundle args plus any additional arguments that haven been passed
                          afterwards. For example:
                          > native-image --bundle-apply=app.nib --bundle-create=app_dbg.nib -g
                          creates a new bundle app_dbg.nib based on the given app.nib bundle.
                          Both bundles are the same except the new one also uses the -g option.

    -E<env-var-key>[=<env-var-value>]
                          allow native-image to access the given environment variable during
                          image build. If the optional <env-var-value> is not given, the value
                          of the environment variable will be taken from the environment
                          native-image was invoked from.

    -V<key>=<value>       provide values for placeholders in native-image.properties files
