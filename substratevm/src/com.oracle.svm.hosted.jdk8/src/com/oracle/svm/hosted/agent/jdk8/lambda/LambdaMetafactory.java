/**
 * <p>
 * Methods to facilitate the creation of simple "function objects" that implement one or more
 * interfaces by delegation to a provided {@link MethodHandle}, possibly after type adaptation and
 * partial evaluation of arguments. These methods are typically used as <em>bootstrap methods</em>
 * for {@code invokedynamic} call sites, to support the <em>lambda expression</em> and <em>method
 * reference expression</em> features of the Java Programming Language.
 *
 * <p>
 * Indirect access to the behavior specified by the provided {@code MethodHandle} proceeds in order
 * through three phases:
 * <ul>
 * <li><em>Linkage</em> occurs when the methods in this class are invoked. They take as arguments an
 * interface to be implemented (typically a <em>functional interface</em>, one with a single
 * abstract method), a name and signature of a method from that interface to be implemented, a
 * method handle describing the desired implementation behavior for that method, and possibly other
 * additional metadata, and produce a {@link CallSite} whose target can be used to create suitable
 * function objects. Linkage may involve dynamically loading a new class that implements the target
 * interface. The {@code CallSite} can be considered a "factory" for function objects and so these
 * linkage methods are referred to as "metafactories".</li>
 *
 * <li><em>Capture</em> occurs when the {@code CallSite}'s target is invoked, typically through an
 * {@code invokedynamic} call site, producing a function object. This may occur many times for a
 * single factory {@code CallSite}. Capture may involve allocation of a new function object, or may
 * return an existing function object. The behavior {@code MethodHandle} may have additional
 * parameters beyond those of the specified interface method; these are referred to as <em>captured
 * parameters</em>, which must be provided as arguments to the {@code CallSite} target, and which
 * may be early-bound to the behavior {@code MethodHandle}. The number of captured parameters and
 * their types are determined during linkage.</li>
 *
 * <li><em>Invocation</em> occurs when an implemented interface method is invoked on a function
 * object. This may occur many times for a single function object. The method referenced by the
 * behavior {@code MethodHandle} is invoked with the captured arguments and any additional arguments
 * provided on invocation, as if by {@link MethodHandle#invoke(Object...)}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is sometimes useful to restrict the set of inputs or results permitted at invocation. For
 * example, when the generic interface {@code Predicate<T>} is parameterized as {@code Predicate
 * <String>}, the input must be a {@code String}, even though the method to implement allows any
 * {@code Object}. At linkage time, an additional {@link MethodType} parameter describes the
 * "instantiated" method type; on invocation, the arguments and eventual result are checked against
 * this {@code MethodType}.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class provides two forms of linkage methods: a standard version (
 * {@link #metafactory(MethodHandles.Lookup, String, MethodType, MethodType, MethodHandle, MethodType)}
 * ) using an optimized protocol, and an alternate version
 * {@link #altMetafactory(MethodHandles.Lookup, String, MethodType, Object...)}). The alternate
 * version is a generalization of the standard version, providing additional control over the
 * behavior of the generated function objects via flags and additional arguments. The alternate
 * version adds the ability to manage the following attributes of function objects:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><em>Bridging.</em> It is sometimes useful to implement multiple variations of the method
 * signature, involving argument or return type adaptation. This occurs when multiple distinct VM
 * signatures for a method are logically considered to be the same method by the language. The flag
 * {@code FLAG_BRIDGES} indicates that a list of additional {@code MethodType}s will be provided,
 * each of which will be implemented by the resulting function object. These methods will share the
 * same name and instantiated type.</li>
 *
 * <li><em>Multiple interfaces.</em> If needed, more than one interface can be implemented by the
 * function object. (These additional interfaces are typically marker interfaces with no methods.)
 * The flag {@code FLAG_MARKERS} indicates that a list of additional interfaces will be provided,
 * each of which should be implemented by the resulting function object.</li>
 *
 * <li><em>Serializability.</em> The generated function objects do not generally support
 * serialization. If desired, {@code FLAG_SERIALIZABLE} can be used to indicate that the function
 * objects should be serializable. Serializable function objects will use, as their serialized form,
 * instances of the class {@code SerializedLambda}, which requires additional assistance from the
 * capturing class (the class described by the {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup}
 * parameter {@code caller}); see {@link SerializedLambda} for details.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Assume the linkage arguments are as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code invokedType} (describing the {@code CallSite} signature) has K parameters of types
 * (D1..Dk) and return type Rd;</li>
 * <li>{@code samMethodType} (describing the implemented method type) has N parameters, of types
 * (U1..Un) and return type Ru;</li>
 * <li>{@code implMethod} (the {@code MethodHandle} providing the implementation has M parameters,
 * of types (A1..Am) and return type Ra (if the method describes an instance method, the method type
 * of this method handle already includes an extra first argument corresponding to the receiver);
 * </li>
 * <li>{@code instantiatedMethodType} (allowing restrictions on invocation) has N parameters, of
 * types (T1..Tn) and return type Rt.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Then the following linkage invariants must hold:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Rd is an interface</li>
 * <li>{@code implMethod} is a <em>direct method handle</em></li>
 * <li>{@code samMethodType} and {@code instantiatedMethodType} have the same arity N, and for
 * i=1..N, Ti and Ui are the same type, or Ti and Ui are both reference types and Ti is a subtype of
 * Ui</li>
 * <li>Either Rt and Ru are the same type, or both are reference types and Rt is a subtype of Ru
 * </li>
 * <li>K + N = M</li>
 * <li>For i=1..K, Di = Ai</li>
 * <li>For i=1..N, Ti is adaptable to Aj, where j=i+k</li>
 * <li>The return type Rt is void, or the return type Ra is not void and is adaptable to Rt</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Further, at capture time, if {@code implMethod} corresponds to an instance method, and there are
 * any capture arguments ({@code K > 0}), then the first capture argument (corresponding to the
 * receiver) must be non-null.
 *
 * <p>
 * A type Q is considered adaptable to S as follows:
 * <table summary="adaptable types">
 * <tr>
 * <th>Q</th>
 * <th>S</th>
 * <th>Link-time checks</th>
 * <th>Invocation-time checks</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Primitive</td>
 * <td>Primitive</td>
 * <td>Q can be converted to S via a primitive widening conversion</td>
 * <td>None</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Primitive</td>
 * <td>Reference</td>
 * <td>S is a supertype of the Wrapper(Q)</td>
 * <td>Cast from Wrapper(Q) to S</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Reference</td>
 * <td>Primitive</td>
 * <td>for parameter types: Q is a primitive wrapper and Primitive(Q) can be widened to S <br>
 * for return types: If Q is a primitive wrapper, check that Primitive(Q) can be widened to S</td>
 * <td>If Q is not a primitive wrapper, cast Q to the base Wrapper(S); for example Number for
 * numeric types</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>Reference</td>
 * <td>Reference</td>
 * <td>for parameter types: S is a supertype of Q <br>
 * for return types: none</td>
 * <td>Cast from Q to S</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * APINote: These linkage methods are designed to support the evaluation of <em>lambda
 * expressions</em> and <em>method references</em> in the Java Language. For every lambda
 * expressions or method reference in the source code, there is a target type which is a functional
 * interface. Evaluating a lambda expression produces an object of its target type. The recommended
 * mechanism for evaluating lambda expressions is to desugar the lambda body to a method, invoke an
 * invokedynamic call site whose static argument list describes the sole method of the functional
 * interface and the desugared implementation method, and returns an object (the lambda object) that
 * implements the target type. (For method references, the implementation method is simply the
 * referenced method; no desugaring is needed.)
 *
 * <p>
 * The argument list of the implementation method and the argument list of the interface method(s)
 * may differ in several ways. The implementation methods may have additional arguments to
 * accommodate arguments captured by the lambda expression; there may also be differences resulting
 * from permitted adaptations of arguments, such as casting, boxing, unboxing, and primitive
 * widening. (Varargs adaptations are not handled by the metafactories; these are expected to be
 * handled by the caller.)
 *
 * <p>
 * Invokedynamic call sites have two argument lists: a static argument list and a dynamic argument
 * list. The static argument list is stored in the constant pool; the dynamic argument is pushed on
 * the operand stack at capture time. The bootstrap method has access to the entire static argument
 * list (which in this case, includes information describing the implementation method, the target
 * interface, and the target interface method(s)), as well as a method signature describing the
 * number and static types (but not the values) of the dynamic arguments and the static return type
 * of the invokedynamic site.
 *
 * ImplNote: The implementation method is described with a method handle. In theory, any method
 * handle could be used. Currently supported are direct method handles representing invocation of
 * virtual, interface, constructor and static methods.
