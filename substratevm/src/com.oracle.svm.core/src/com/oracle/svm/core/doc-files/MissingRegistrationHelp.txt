Throw Native Image-specific errors when trying to access an element that has not been registered.
This can happen on reflection and serialization queries, and resource access.
If used without args, the errors will be thrown when calling the corresponding query from any class in scope of the option.

Using -H:ThrowMissingRegistrationErrors without arguments is only allowed on command line or when embedded in a
native-image.properties file of some zip/jar file on the module-path (but not on class-path).

In the module path case, the option will cause all classes of the module to trigger missing registration errors.
If used without arguments on command line all classes will trigger missing registration errors.

Using -H:ThrowMissingRegistrationErrors with arguments is allowed in every scope:

  1. On command line
  2. Embedded in a native-image.properties file of some zip/jar file on module-path
  3. Embedded in a native-image.properties file of some zip/jar file on class-path

If the option is embedded in native-image.properties file in some zip/jar file all class-names
and package-names passed to the option have to be found in the zip/jar files the option is embedded
in. Using -H:ThrowMissingRegistrationErrors with arguments on command line does not have that restriction.
