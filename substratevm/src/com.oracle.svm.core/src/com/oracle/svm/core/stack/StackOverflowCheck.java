/**
 * This interface provides functions related to stack overflow checking that are invoked by other
 * parts of Substrate VM. Most of the actual stack overflow handling is done using Graal nodes and
 * lowerings, i.e., in the Graal-specific implementation class {@code StackOverflowCheckImpl}.
 *
 * Substrate VM uses explicit stack overflow checks: at the beginning of every method, the current
 * stack pointer is compared with the allowed boundary of the stack pointer. The boundary is stored
 * in a {@link FastThreadLocalWord thread local variable}. So the fast-path cost of a stack overflow
 * check is one memory load, a comparison, and a conditional branch instruction.
 *
 * When a stack overflow is detected, a {@link StackOverflowError} is thrown. Allocating the error
 * object, filling in the stack trace, and performing the stack unwinding to find the matching
 * exception handler is all implemented in Java code too. Therefore, a stack overflow must be
 * detected while there is still sufficient stack memory available to execute these Java functions
 * (and they of course must not recursively throw a {@link StackOverflowError} again). Therefore, we
 * designate two zones toward the end of the stack: the "yellow zone" and the "red zone".
 *
 * The yellow zone can be made available to regular Java code by modifying the thread local variable
 * that holds the boundary. Calling {@link #makeYellowZoneAvailable()} makes the yellow zone
 * available, and a matching call of {@link #protectYellowZone()} makes the yellow zone unavailable
 * again for usage. The yellow zone is fairly commonly used by Substrate VM Java code, but it is not
 * intended for application code, i.e., the yellow zone should not be made available in places where
 * the VM calls back to application code. {@link VMOperation} such as the GC always make the yellow
 * zone available: a {@link StackOverflowError} during GC would be a fatal error because
 * interrupting GC leaves the heap in an inconsistent state. So it is better to make the yellow zone
 * available upfront. The yellow zone is sized (by empirical measurement and testing) so that a GC
 * can be executed in it.
 *
 * The red zone is reserved for last-resort error handling on the Java and C side. Code marked as
 * {@link Uninterruptible} can use the red zone because such methods do not start with a stack
 * overflow check. C code can also use the red zone, e.g., for exiting the VM in case of a fatal
 * error. The red zone is small and sized just to do something slightly better than a segmentation
 * fault.
