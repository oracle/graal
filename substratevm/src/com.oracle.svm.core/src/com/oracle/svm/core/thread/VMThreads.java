     * Only use this mutex if it is absolutely necessary to operate on the linked list of
     * {@link IsolateThread}s. This mutex is especially dangerous because it is used by the
     * application, the GC, and the safepoint mechanism. To avoid potential deadlocks, all places
     * that acquire this mutex must do one of the following:
     *
     * <ol type="a">
     * <li>Acquire the mutex within a VM operation: this is safe because it fixes the order in which
     * the mutexes are acquired (VMOperation queue mutex first, {@link #THREAD_MUTEX} second). If
     * the VM operation causes a safepoint, then it is possible that the {@link #THREAD_MUTEX} was
     * already acquired for safepoint reasons.</li>
     * <li>Acquire the mutex from a thread that is not yet attached
     * ({@link StatusSupport#STATUS_CREATED}).</li>
     * <li>Acquire the mutex from a thread that is in native code
     * ({@link StatusSupport#STATUS_IN_NATIVE}). This is also possible from a thread that is in Java
     * state by doing an explicit transition to native, see
     * {@link #lockThreadMutexInNativeCode}.</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * Deadlock example 1:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Thread A acquires the {@link #THREAD_MUTEX}.</li>
     * <li>Thread B queues a VM operation and therefore holds the corresponding VM operation queue
     * mutex.</li>
     * <li>Thread A allocates an object and the allocation wants to trigger a GC. So, a VM operation
     * needs to be queued, and thread A tries to acquire the VM operation queue mutex. Thread A is
     * blocked because thread B holds that mutex.</li>
     * <li>Thread B needs to initiate a safepoint before executing the VM operation. So, it tries to
     * acquire the {@link #THREAD_MUTEX} and is blocked because thread A holds that mutex.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * Deadlock example 2:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Thread A acquires the {@link #THREAD_MUTEX}.</li>
     * <li>Thread A allocates an object and the allocation wants to trigger a GC. So, a VM operation
     * is queued and thread A blocks until the VM operation is completed.</li>
     * <li>The dedicated VM operation thread needs to initiate a safepoint for the execution of the
     * VM operation. So, it tries to acquire {@link #THREAD_MUTEX} and is blocked because thread A
     * still holds that mutex.</li>
     * </ul>
