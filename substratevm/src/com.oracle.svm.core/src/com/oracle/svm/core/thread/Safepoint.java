/**
 * Support for initiating safepoints, which are a global state in which all threads are paused so
 * that an invasive operation (such as garbage collection) can execute without interferences.
 * <p>
 * When a safepoint is requested, one thread (the master) will acquire a mutex for the duration of
 * this safepoint operation. The master will set the thread-local variable
 * {@link #safepointRequested} of each other thread (the slaves) accordingly.
 * <p>
 * The slaves occasionally check their thread-local {@link #safepointRequested} values, and if a
 * safepoint is pending, they call {@link Safepoint#slowPathSafepointCheck} to block on the mutex
 * that the master is holding. Blocking on the mutex (or other native calls) will transition the
 * slaves to being in native code, via CFunctionSnippets.prologueSnippet().
 * <p>
 * The master loops waiting for each slave to be in native code. At that point the master will
 * atomically change the thread status of the slave to being at a safepoint. Once a thread is at a
 * safepoint, CFunctionSnippets.epilogueSnippet() will prevent it from returning to Java code.
 * <p>
 * When all slaves are at the safepoint, the master can execute any VMOperations that have
 * accumulated. When the VMOperation queues are empty, the master will change the status of each
 * slave back to being in native code. Once a slave is back in native code, it might return to Java
 * code, though any slaves that noticed the safepoint request will be blocked on the mutex. Then the
 * master drops the mutex, and the slaves that were blocked on the mutex are free to continue their
 * execution.
 * <p>
 * CFunctionSnippets.epilogueSnippet() tries to do an atomic compare-and-set of the thread status
 * from being in native code to being in Java code. In the usual case (the fast path) that will
 * succeed and the thread will be back running Java code. If, however, the thread was
 * <em>already</em> in native code when the safepoint was requested, it will have missed the request
 * and will not be blocked on the mutex. In that case the atomic compare-and-set fails because the
 * thread state is at a safepoint. The failure will send the thread to the slow path which will
 * block on the mutex.
 * <p>
 * {@link VMThreads#THREAD_MUTEX} is used as the mutex on which slaves block to freeze and is a
 * natural choice because the master also has to hold that mutex to walk the thread list. Because
 * the mutex is held from the time the safepoint is initiated until it is complete, new threads can
 * not be created (or attached) during the safepoint.
 * <p>
 * A safepoint check is implemented as a check of {@link #safepointRequested} <= 0, which, if true,
 * triggers a call to {@link #slowPathSafepointCheck}. {@link ThreadingSupportFeature} implements an
 * optional per-thread timer on top of the safepoint mechanism. If that timer feature is
 * {@linkplain ThreadingSupportImpl.Options#SupportRecurringCallback supported in the image}, each
 * safepoint check decrements {@link #safepointRequested} before the comparison, which will cause it
 * to periodically enter the slow path. If a timer is registered and the slow path determines that
 * that timer has expired, the timer callback is executed and {@link #safepointRequested} is reset
 * with a value that estimates the number of safepoint checks during the intended timer interval.
 * When an actual safepoint is requested, the master does an arithmetic negation of each slave's
 * {@link #safepointRequested} value to make it enter the slow path on the next safepoint check.
 * When no timer is active on a thread, its {@link #safepointRequested} value is reset to
 * {@link Safepoint#THREAD_REQUEST_RESET}. Because {@link #safepointRequested} still eventually
 * decrements to 0, threads can very infrequently call {@link #slowPathSafepointCheck} without
 * cause.
