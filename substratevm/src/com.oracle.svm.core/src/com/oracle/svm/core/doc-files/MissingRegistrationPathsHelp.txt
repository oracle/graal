Trigger missing registration errors from all types in the given class or module-path entries.

This option requires arguments that are of the same type as the
arguments passed via -p (--module-path) or -cp (--class-path):

  -H:ThrowMissingRegistrationErrorsPaths <class search path of directories and zip/jar files>

The given entries are searched and all classes inside are registered as -H:ThrowMissingRegistrationErrorsPaths classes.

This option is only allowed to be used on command line. I.e. the option will be rejected if it is provided
by Args of a native-image.properties file embedded in a zip/jar file.
