/**
 * In additional to the traditional singleton model, i.e. a key-value map whose lookups are constant
 * folded within generated code, we provide two additional options:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ApplicationLayerOnlyImageSingleton}: Instead of having a per-layer singleton, all
 * {@link ImageSingletons#lookup} calls refer to a single singleton which will be created in the
 * application layer.</li>
 *
 * <li>{@link MultiLayeredImageSingleton}: {@link ImageSingletons#lookup} calls continue to refer to
 * the appropriate per layer image singleton, but there is also an additional method
 * {@link MultiLayeredImageSingleton#getAllLayers} which returns an array with the image singletons
 * corresponding to this key in all layers they were created. The length of this array will vary
 * from [0, total #layers], based on the number of layers singletons were installed in (i.e., it is
 * not required for the singleton to be installed in all layers). Within the array, the singletons
 * will be arranged so that index [0] corresponds to the singleton originating from the oldest layer
 * in which the singleton was installed and index [length - 1] holds the singleton from the newest
 * layer.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Note the unique behavior of {@link ApplicationLayerOnlyImageSingleton} applies only when building
 * a layered image. Calling {@link MultiLayeredImageSingleton#getAllLayers} during a traditional
 * build requires the singleton to be installed in the build and will return an array of length 1
 * containing that singleton.
 *
 * Currently, when using these special singleton types there are additional restrictions:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>The key class type must match the implementation type</li>
 * <li>The same object cannot be mapped into multiple keys, i.e. there is a one-to-one mapping
 * between Class<->singleton object</li>
 * <li>{@link ImageSingletons#add} must be called before the analysis phase (i.e. these image
 * singletons cannot be added at a later point)</li>
 * <li>{@link ApplicationLayerOnlyImageSingleton}s can only be installed in the application
 * layer</li>
 * </ol>
