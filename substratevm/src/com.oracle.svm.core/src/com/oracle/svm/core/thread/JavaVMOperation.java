/**
 * The abstract base class for all VM operations that are allocated on the Java heap. Allocating the
 * VM operation on the Java heap is preferable but not always possible (see
 * {@link NativeVMOperation}). {@link JavaVMOperation} objects should be short lived and only
 * enqueued/executed once. For increased thread safety, it is prohibited to allocate
 * {@link JavaVMOperation}s that live in the image heap (see note below).
 * <p>
 * Note: the VM operation infrastructure supports that {@link JavaVMOperation}s are reused and
 * executed multiple times. However, extra care must be taken as each VM operation object can only
 * be in the VM operation queue once. Therefore, it must be guaranteed that the VM operation is
 * executed before it is enqueued again. Otherwise, this could result in various race conditions,
 * especially if {@linkplain ConcealedOptions#UseDedicatedVMOperationThread} is enabled.
