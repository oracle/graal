/**
 * {@link JavaMonitor} is based on the code of {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock} as
 * of JDK 19 (git commit hash: f640fc5a1eb876a657d0de011dcd9b9a42b88eec, JDK tag: jdk-19+30).
 *
 * Only the relevant methods from the JDK sources have been kept. Some additional Native
 * Image-specific functionality has been added.
 *
 * Main differences to the JDK implementation:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Uses the {@linkplain #setState synchronization state} to store a
 * {@linkplain #getThreadIdentity numeric identifier of the owner thread} and {@link #acquisitions}
 * to store the number of lock acquisitions, enabling various optimizations.</li>
 * </ul>
