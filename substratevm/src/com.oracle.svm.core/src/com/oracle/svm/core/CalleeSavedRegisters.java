/**
 * This class provides support for callee-saved registers to the rest of the VM.
 *
 * For normal Java-to-Java calls, all registers are caller saved. That simplifies many things
 * related to stack walking because caller and callee frames are independent: all values in the
 * caller frame at a call site are spilled at a location known when compiling the caller frame.
 *
 * But for slow-path stub calls, caller-saved registers have severe performance implications: all
 * registers must be spilled at the call site. This means every loop has at least one call (the
 * safepoint check) where all values are spilled. This degrades code quality. For stub calls,
 * therefore all registers should be callee saved. This means that for all practical use cases
 * either none or all registers are callee saved, which makes the implementation simpler.
 *
 * For all methods with callee-saved registers, the memory area where the callee saves the register
 * to is located at the {@link #saveAreaOffsetInFrame same offset} relative to the caller frame, and
 * has the {@link #saveAreaSize same size}. This ensures that caller and callee are still
 * independent: the caller knows at which offset (relative to the stack pointer) a register is saved
 * by the callee. This is a {@link #getOffsetInFrame negative offset} relative to the caller frame's
 * stack pointer.
 *
 * Callee-saved registers must be supported in reference maps for the GC, and in deoptimization
 * information. Because of the fixed offsets, there is no difference between a caller-spilled value
 * (a stack slot with a positive offset relative to the caller frame's stack pointer) and a
 * callee-saved value (a negative offset relative to the caller frame's stack pointer). So as long
 * as reference maps and deoptimization information support negative stack slot offsets, no special
 * handling for callee saved registers is necessary. Both
 * {@link SubstrateReferenceMapBuilder#addLiveValue} and {@link FrameInfoEncoder} use
 * {@link #getOffsetInFrame} to look up the callee-save offset for a register.
