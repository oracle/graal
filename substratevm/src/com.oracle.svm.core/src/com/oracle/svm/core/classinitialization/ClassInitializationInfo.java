 * Information about the runtime class initialization state of a {@link DynamicHub class}, and

 * specification.
 * <p>
 * The information is not directly stored in {@link DynamicHub} because 1) the class initialization
 * state is mutable while {@link DynamicHub} must be immutable, and 2) few classes require
 * initialization at runtime so factoring out the information reduces image size.
 * <p>
 * Note that methods of this class never show up in exception stack traces (i.e., all related frames
 * will be filtered from the stack trace, see {@link InternalVMMethod} annotation below). This can
 * be especially confusing for implicit exceptions such as {@link NullPointerException} or
 * {@link AssertionError} as the stack trace will look as if the caller caused the exception.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #typeReached} for all super types must have a value whose ordinal is greater or equal
 * to its own value. Concretely, {@link TypeReached#REACHED} types must have all super types
 * {@link TypeReached#REACHED} or {@link TypeReached#UNTRACKED}, and {@link TypeReached#UNTRACKED}
 * types' super types must be {@link TypeReached#UNTRACKED}. This is verified in
