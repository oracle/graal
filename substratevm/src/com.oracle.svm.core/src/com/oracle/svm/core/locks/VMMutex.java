/**
 * A mutex that has minimal requirements on Java code. The implementation does not perform memory
 * allocation, exception unwinding, or other complicated operations. This allows it to be used in
 * early startup and shutdown phases of the VM, as well as to coordinate garbage collection.
 *
 * Higher-level code that does not have these restrictions should use regular locks from the JDK
 * instead, i.e., implementations of {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock}.
 *
 * It is not possible to allocate new VM mutexes at run time. All VM mutexes must be allocated
 * during image generation. They are initialized during startup of the VM, i.e., every VM mutex
 * consumes resources and contributes to VM startup time.
 *
 * This class is almost an abstract base class for VMMutex. Sub-classes replace instances of VMMutex
 * with platform-specific implementations.
