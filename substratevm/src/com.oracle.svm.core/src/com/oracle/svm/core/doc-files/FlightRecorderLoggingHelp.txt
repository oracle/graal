Usage: -XX:FlightRecorderLogging=[tag1[+tag2...][*][=level][,...]]

When this option is not set, logging is enabled at a level of WARNING.
When this option is set to the empty string, logging is enabled at a level of INFO.
When this option is set to "disable", logging is disabled entirely.

Otherwise, this option expects a comma separated list of tag combinations, each with an optional wildcard (*) and level.
A tag combination without a level is given a default level of INFO.
Messages with tags that match a given tag combination are set to log at that tag combination's level.
If a tag combination does not have a wildcard, then only messages with exactly the same tags are matched.
Otherwise, messages whose tags are a subset of the tag combination are matched.
Specifying "all" instead of a tag combination matches all tag combinations.
If more than one tag combination matches a message's tags, the rightmost one will apply.
Messages with tags that do not have any matching tag combinations are set to log at a default level of WARNING.
This option is case insensitive.

Available log levels:
[trace, debug, info, warning, error, off]

Available log tags:
[jfr, system, event, setting, bytecode, parser, metadata, dcmd]
