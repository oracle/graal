/**
 * Any method with this annotation must not have a safepoint in it.
 * <p>
 * For example, a method that allocates raw memory must not contain a safepoint at least until it
 * has installed a DynamicHub on the memory and made sure that all the object references indicated
 * by that DynamicHub are valid object references.
 * <p>
 * Methods annotated with {@link Uninterruptible} can only call
 * <ul>
 * <li>Other methods annotated with {@link Uninterruptible}.</li>
 * <li>Methods annotated with {@link Fold}.</li>
 * <li>Methods from {@link KnownIntrinsics}.</li>
 * <li>Operations on {@link WordBase}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * When a method overrides an uninterruptible method, it must be annotated with
 * {@link Uninterruptible} too. This ensures that virtual calls do not violate uninterruptible
 * semantics. Covariant return types are not allowed when overriding a method, i.e., the base method
 * and the override must have the exact same declared return type. Covariant return types require a
 * synthetic bridge method that is generated automatically by the Java compiler, and not all Java
 * compilers put the {@link Uninterruptible} annotation on the bridge metod too (for example ECJ).
 * For consistency reasons, synthetic methods are therefore never treated as uninterruptible.
 * <p>
 * Annotated methods give a terse {@link #reason} why they are annotated. Often the reason is that
 * the method is called from some other method annotated with {@link Uninterruptible}.
 * <p>
 * Annotated methods usually say that methods they call must be annotated with
 * {@link Uninterruptible}, though they can use {@link #calleeMustBe "calleeMustBe = false"} to
 * indicate that the callee need not be so annotated. I use that to avoid having to annotate the
 * whole stack printing mechanism when I am about to exit the virtual machine.
 * <p>
 * Annotated methods can use {@link #callerMustBe "callerMustBe = true"} to indicate that their
 * caller must also be annotated with {@link Uninterruptible}. I use that, for example when a method
 * allocates uninitialized storage and returns a Pointer to it. Such a method must only be called
 * from a method annotated with {@link Uninterruptible}.
 * <p>
 * Most methods annotated with {@link Uninterruptible} can not be inlined into interruptible code,
 * because their operations might be intermingled into code that can cause safepoints. If a method
 * is so simple that it can always be inlined into interruptible code, the method can be annotated
 * with {@link #mayBeInlined "mayBeInlined = true"}. Uninterruptible methods can always be inlined
 * into other uninterruptible methods.
 * <dl>
 * Some alternatives to annotation:
 * <dt>Code called from snippets</dt>
 * <dd>Snippet code is always inlined and runs to completion. Methods called only from snippets need
 * not be annotated.</dd>
 * <dt>Code called from VMOperations</dt>
 * <dd>VMOperation code runs single-threaded to completion. Public entry points that should only run
 * in VMOperations can be guarded with a call to
 * {@linkplain VMOperation#guaranteeInProgress(String)}.</dd>
 * </dl>
