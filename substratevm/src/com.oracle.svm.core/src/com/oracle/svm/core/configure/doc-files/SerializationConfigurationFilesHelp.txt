One or several (comma-separated) paths to JSON files that specify lists of serialization configurations.
The structure is an array of elements specifying the target serialization/deserialization class.

Example:

    [
      {
        "condition":{"typeReachable":"app.DataSerializer"},
        "name":"java.util.ArrayList"
      }
    ]

This JSON file format is also used for the serialization deny list.

In rare cases an application might explicitly make calls to

    ReflectionFactory.newConstructorForSerialization(Class<?> cl, Constructor<?> constructorToCall)

where the passed `constructorToCall` differs from what would automatically be used if regular serialization of `cl`
would happen. To also support such serialization usecases it is possible to register serialization for a class with a
custom constructorToCall. For example, to allow serialization of `org.apache.spark.SparkContext$$anonfun$hadoopFile$1`
using the DeclaredConstructor of java.lang.Object as custom targetConstructor the following can be used in
serialization-config.json:

    [
      {
        "condition":{"typeReachable":"org.apache.spark.SparkContext"},
        "name":"org.apache.spark.SparkContext$$anonfun$hadoopFile$1",
        "customTargetConstructorClass":"java.lang.Object"
      }
    ]
