One or several (comma-separated) paths to JSON files that specify lists of serialization configurations.

The structure is described in the following schema:

  https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/docs/reference-manual/native-image/assets/serialization-config-schema-v1.1.0.json

Example:

    {
      "serialization": [
        {
        "condition" : {
          "typeReachable" : "app.DataSerializer"
        },
        "name" : "java.util.ArrayList"
      }
      ]
    }


In rare cases an application might explicitly make calls to

    ReflectionFactory.newConstructorForSerialization(Class<?> cl, Constructor<?> constructorToCall)

The specified `constructorToCall` differs from the one that would be automatically used during regular serialization of `cl`.
When a class is registered for run-time serialization, all potential custom constructors are automatically registered.
As a result, this use case does not require any additional metadata.
