# This script takes the CaseFolding.txt and UnicodeData.txt files of the Unicode
# character database and extracts from them the files UnicodeFoldTable.txt and
# NonUnicodeFoldTable.txt. These files contain definitions of the Canonicalize
# abstract function used in the ECMAScript spec to define case folding in
# regular expressions. UnicodeFoldTable.txt contains the definition of case
# folding for when the Unicode ('u') flag is present and NonUnicodeFoldTable.txt
# contains the definition of case folding for when the Unicode flag is missing.
# These two files are then picked up by the generate_case_fold_table.clj script
# which produces Java code that can be put into the CaseFoldTable class in
# TRegex.

# We produce the table for the Canonicalize abstract function when the Unicode
# flag is present. The function is based on the contents of CodeFolding.txt. We
# remove any comments and empty lines from the file. We also remove items
# belonging from the full (F) and Turkic (T) mapping and only keep the simple
# (S) and common (C) ones.

# We produce the table for the Canonicalize abstract function when the Unicode
# flag is not present. We extract the Unicode Case Conversion table from the
# UnicodeData.txt and SpecialCasing.txt files. We remove entries which map from
# non-ASCII code points (>= 128) to ASCII code points (< 128), as per the
# ECMAScript spec. We also drop the special entries which produce strings of more
# than one UTF-16 code unit.

# In Python's case insensitive regular expressions, characters are considered
# equivalent if they have the same Lowercase mapping. However, in some cases
# concerning character classes, Python also tries to match character by
# considering their Uppercase mapping. In recent revisions of CPython 3, this is
# supplemented by an explicit list of equivalence classes of lowercase
# characters which are to be considered equal since they have the same Uppercase
# mapping.

# One approach to model this would be to generate the case fold table from the
# equivalences given by the Lowercase mappings and the special list of
# exceptions used in CPython. However, this might not account for some of the
# matches due to the use of Uppercase matching in ranges of characters in
# Unicode character classes. By using both the Uppercase and Lowercase mappings,
# we arrive at a larger equivalence relation, but one that might be more in the
# spirit of what CPython is trying to model.

# We make characters equivalent to their simple Uppercase and Lowercase
# mappings. We filter out the codepoint and the three character mappings, remove
# any empty fields by collapsing neighboring or terminating semicolons and
# finally removing any lines consisting of a single codepoint (the case when a
# character has cased mappings).

# The Python case folding algorithm also makes use of the extended case mappings
# defined in SpecialCasing.txt. These occur when, e.g., a single character is
# mapped to multiple characters. In this case, Python makes a character
# equivalent to the first character it maps to.
# When processing the file, we strip away the comments and blank lines. Then we
# reduce each codepoint sequence to just its first codepoint. Finally, we drop
# any missing entries (by collapsing neighboring or terminating semicolons).
