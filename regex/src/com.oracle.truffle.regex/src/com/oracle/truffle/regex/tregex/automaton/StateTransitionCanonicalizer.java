     * intersection in their respective set of expected characters. We initially define the result
     * as an empty list.</li>
     * <li>For every element <em>e</em> of the input list, we compare the expected character sets of
     * <em>e</em> and every element in the result list. If an intersection with an element
     * <em>r</em> of the result list is found, we distinguish the following two cases, where the
     * character set of an element <em>x</em> is denoted as <em>x.cs</em> and the transition set of
     * an element <em>x</em> is denoted as <em>x.ts</em>:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If <em>e.cs</em> contains <em>r.cs</em>, <em>e.ts</em> is merged into <em>r.ts</em> using
     * TransitionSet#addAll(TransitionSet).</li>
     * <li>Otherwise, a new transition containing <em>e.ts</em> and <em>r.ts</em> and the
     * intersection of <em>e.cs</em> and <em>r.cs</em> is added to the result list. This new
     * transition is created using TransitionBuilder#createMerged(TransitionBuilder, CodePointSet).
     * The intersection of <em>e.cs</em> and <em>r.cs</em> is removed from <em>r.cs</em>.</li>
     * </ul>
     * </li>
     * <li>Every time an intersection is found, that intersection is removed from <em>e.cs</em>. If
     * <em>e.cs</em> is not empty after <em>e</em> has been compared to every element of the result
     * list, <em>e</em> is added to the result list.</li>
     * <li>The result list at all times fulfills the property that no two elements in the list
     * intersect.</li>
     * </ul>
     * This algorithm has an important property: every entry in the input list will be merged with
     * the elements it intersects with <em>in the order of the input list</em>. This means that
     * given an input list {@code [1, 2, 3]} where all elements intersect with each other, element
     * {@code 2} will be merged with {@code 1} before {@code 3} is merged with {@code 1}. This
     * property is crucial for generating priority-sensitive DFAs, since we track priorities of NFA
     * transitions by their order!

     *
     * <pre>
     * input: [
     *   {transitionSet {1}, matcherBuilder [ab]},
     *   {transitionSet {2}, matcherBuilder [bc]}

     *   {transitionSet {1, 2}, matcherBuilder [b]},
