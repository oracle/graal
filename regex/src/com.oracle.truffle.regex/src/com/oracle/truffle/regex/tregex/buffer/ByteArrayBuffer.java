 * This class is designed as a "scratchpad" for generating many byte arrays of unknown size. It will

 * Usage Example:

 *
 * <pre>
 * ByteArrayBuffer buf = new ByteArrayBuffer();
 * List<byte[]> results = new ArrayList<>();
 * for (Object obj : listOfThingsToProcess) {
 *     for (Object x : obj.thingsThatShouldBecomeBytes()) {
 *         buf.add(someCalculation(x));

 *     results.add(buf.toArray());
 *     buf.clear();
