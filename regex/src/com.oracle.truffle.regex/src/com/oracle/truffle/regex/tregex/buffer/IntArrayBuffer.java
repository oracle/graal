/**
 * This class is designed as a "scratchpad" for generating many char arrays of unknown size. It will
 * never shrink its internal buffer, so it should be disposed as soon as it is no longer needed.
 * <p>
 * Usage Example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * IntArrayBuffer buf = new IntArrayBuffer();
 * List<int[]> results = new ArrayList<>();
 * for (Object obj : listOfThingsToProcess) {
 *     for (Object x : obj.thingsThatShouldBecomeInts()) {
 *         buf.add(someCalculation(x));
 *     }
 *     results.add(buf.toArray());
 *     buf.clear();
 * }
