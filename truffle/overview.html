Truffle is a framework for writing and executing interpreters. In case
you want to execute already written interpreters from your Java application,
start at {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.vm.PolyglotEngine}. In case you'd like
to write your own Truffle based language, start at 
{@link com.oracle.truffle.api.TruffleLanguage}.
<p>
To get the best speed out of your Truffle system, make sure you are running
on top of 
<a target="graal" href="https://github.com/graalvm/graal-core/">Graal</a>
virtual machine. The easiest way to get binaries of the virtual machine
is to download the
<a target="graal" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oracle-labs/program-languages/overview/index.html">
OTN technology preview</a>.

<h4>Using Truffle</h4>

You can embed any Truffle language into your existing Java program. The central
class to start at is {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.vm.PolyglotEngine}. Once
you have an instance of {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.vm.PolyglotEngine}, you
can {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.vm.PolyglotEngine#eval evaluate}
{@link com.oracle.truffle.api.source.Source sources} written in any language
the {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.vm.PolyglotEngine} understands.

The set of supported languages is determined by putting their JAR files
on a classpath of your application. Some languages are available in central
<a href="http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|a%3A%22jruby-truffle%22">Maven repository</a>.
To include them, modify your <code>pom.xml</code> file (if using Maven) dependency section:

<pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.jruby&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;jruby-truffle&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;9.1.2.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre>

Other languages may be prepackaged in your virtual machine. For example when
using the
<a target="graal" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oracle-labs/program-languages/overview/index.html">
OTN Graal VM</a> one can start the <em>java</em> executable with
parameter <code>-polyglot</code> and the 
<a target="graal" href="https://github.com/graalvm/fastr">FastR</a>,
JavaScript and 
<a target="graal" href="https://github.com/jruby/jruby/wiki/Truffle">TruffleRuby</a>
languages will be made available automatically.

<h4>Learning Truffle</h4>

<p>
Our typical sample language is called the <em>SimpleLanguage</em>.
A good entry point for exploring <em>SimpleLanguage</em> is the
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/graalvm/Truffle/blob/master/truffle/com.oracle.truffle.sl/src/com/oracle/truffle/sl/SLLanguage.java">SLLanguage</a>
class.
</p>

<p>
    There is an excellent tutorial <em>Add Graal JIT Compilation to Your JVM Language</em>
    written by Stefan Marr which gives real example of turning an existing language
    into <em>Truffle</em> based one:

    </li>
    <li>Step 5:

    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The posts cover not only basics, and API usage, but also description
    of available tools for analyzing the performance and optimizing it.

<h4>Keeping Compatibility</h4>

<p>
The <b>Truffle</b> API values work of its adopters and as such it is developed
with compatibility in mind. Methods and features are not removed and renamed
randomly, without a notice and there is a binary compatibility testing framework
in place to verify that.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand the <b>Truffle</b> project is still young and needs a way
to refine and change previously taken decisions. To balance the need between
compatibility and give us a way to remove things from the API we following
these rules:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rather than removing/renaming or changing an API element (class, method,
        field), mark it <em>deprecated</em>.</li>
    <li>Make sure usage of such element can be replaced by non-deprecated ways</li>
    <li>Keep such element working until next release</li>
    <li>If possible provide automatic migration using Jackpot's META-INF/upgrade/ files</li>
    <li>When new (major) release is out, remove it</li>
</ul>
<p>
By deprecating parts of API while keeping them functional we are giving
users of the <b>Truffle</b> API time to adjust to required
changes and (under the assumption they pay attention to warnings in the code
base) easily identify and migrate to more modern API alternatives.
