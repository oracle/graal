     * Controls the behavior of the {@link ExplodeLoop} annotation.

     * <h2>Terminology</h2>
     *
     * In the explanations below, the term <i>loop end</i> refers to control flow reaching the end
     * of the loop body such as {@code continue} or a statement at the end of the loop body. The
     * term <i>loop exit</i> refers to control flow exiting the loop, such as {@code return} or
     * {@code break}. Example:
     *
     * {@snippet file="com/oracle/truffle/api/nodes/ExplodeLoop.java" region="loopEndsExits"}
     *
     * There are 4 loop explosion kinds (plus {@code MERGE_EXPLODE}, which is meant for bytecode
     * interpreters), configurable by 2 parameters: UNROLL vs EXPLODE and UNTIL_RETURN vs not.
     *
     * <h2>UNROLL vs EXPLODE</h2>
     *
     * The first parameter specifies whether the partial evaluator should duplicate loop ends.
     * UNROLL merges after each loop end and EXPLODE keeps exploding nested iterations like a tree.
     *
     * {@snippet file="com/oracle/truffle/api/nodes/ExplodeLoop.java" region="unrollVsExplodeLoop"}
     *
     * gets unrolled with {@code FULL_UNROLL} to:
     *
     * {@snippet file="com/oracle/truffle/api/nodes/ExplodeLoop.java"
     * region="unrollVsExplodeLoopUnrolled"}
     *
     * and exploded with {@code FULL_EXPLODE} to:
     *
     * {@snippet file="com/oracle/truffle/api/nodes/ExplodeLoop.java"
     * region="unrollVsExplodeLoopExploded"}
     *
     * <h2>UNTIL_RETURN</h2>
     *
     * The second parameter specifies whether the partial evaluator should duplicate loop exits.
     * UNTIL_RETURN duplicates them, otherwise control flow is merged.
     *
     * {@snippet file="com/oracle/truffle/api/nodes/ExplodeLoop.java" region="untilReturnLoop"}
     *
     * is expanded with {@code FULL_UNROLL_UNTIL_RETURN} to:
     *
     * {@snippet file="com/oracle/truffle/api/nodes/ExplodeLoop.java" region="untilReturn"}
     *
     * while {@code FULL_UNROLL} merges loop exits:
     *
     * {@snippet file="com/oracle/truffle/api/nodes/ExplodeLoop.java" region="notUntilReturn"}
     *
     * <h3>break</h3>
     *
     * Note that {@code break} statements inside the loop will duplicate code after the loop since
     * they add new loop exits:
     *
     * {@snippet file="com/oracle/truffle/api/nodes/ExplodeLoop.java" region="breaksLoop"}
     *
     * is expanded with {@code FULL_UNROLL_UNTIL_RETURN} to:
     *
     * {@snippet file="com/oracle/truffle/api/nodes/ExplodeLoop.java"
     * region="breaksLoopUnrollUntilReturn"}
