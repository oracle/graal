/**
 * Represents the root node in a Truffle AST. The root node is a {@link Node node} that allows to be
 * {@link #execute(VirtualFrame) executed} using a {@link VirtualFrame frame} instance created by
 * the framework. Please note that the {@link RootNode} should not be executed directly but using
 * {@link CallTarget#call(Object...)}. The structure of the frame is provided by the
 * {@link FrameDescriptor frame descriptor} passed in the constructor. A root node has always a
 * <code>null</code> {@link #getParent() parent} and cannot be {@link #replace(Node) replaced}.
 *
 * <h4>Construction</h4>
 *
 * The root node can be constructed with a {@link TruffleLanguage language implementation} if it is
 * available. The language implementation instance is obtainable while
 * {@link TruffleLanguage#createContext(Env)} or {@link TruffleLanguage#parse(ParsingRequest)} is
 * executed. If no language environment is available, then <code>null</code> can be passed. Please
 * note that root nodes with <code>null</code> language are considered not instrumentable and don't
 * have access to its public {@link #getLanguageInfo() language information}.
 *
 * <h4>Execution</h4>
 *
 * In order to execute a root node, its call target is lazily created and can be accessed via
 * {@link RootNode#getCallTarget()}. This allows the runtime system to optimize the execution of the
 * AST. The {@link CallTarget} can either be {@link CallTarget#call(Object...) called} directly from
 * runtime code or {@link DirectCallNode direct} and {@link IndirectCallNode indirect} call nodes
 * can be created, inserted in a child field and {@link DirectCallNode#call(Object[]) called}. The
 * use of direct call nodes allows the framework to automatically inline and further optimize call
 * sites based on heuristics.
 * <p>
 * After several calls to a call target or call node, the root node might get compiled using partial
 * evaluation. The details of the compilation heuristic are unspecified, therefore the Truffle
 * runtime system might decide to not compile at all.
 *
 * <h4>Cardinalities</h4>
 *
 * <i>One</i> root node instance refers to other classes using the following cardinalities:
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>one</i> {@link TruffleLanguage language}
 * <li><i>one</i> {@link CallTarget call target}
 * <li><i>many</i> {@link TruffleLanguage#createContext(Env) created} language contexts
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h4>Instrumentation</h4>
 *
 * A root node can be {@linkplain com.oracle.truffle.api.instrumentation instrumented} if the
 * following conditions apply:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A non-null {@link TruffleLanguage language} is passed in the root node constructor.
 * <li>{@link #isInstrumentable()} is overridden and returns <code>true</code>.
 * <li>{@link #getSourceSection()} is overridden and returns a non-null value.
 * <li>The AST contains at least one node that implements
 * {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.instrumentation.InstrumentableNode}.
 * <li>It is recommended that children of instrumentable root nodes are tagged with
 * <code>StandardTags</code>.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> It is recommended to override {@link #getSourceSection()} and provide a
 * source section if available. This allows for better testing/tracing/tooling. If no concrete
 * source section is available please consider using {@link Source#createUnavailableSection()}.
