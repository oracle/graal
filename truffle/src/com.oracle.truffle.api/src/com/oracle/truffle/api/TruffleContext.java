/**
 * A handle on a context of a set of Truffle languages. This context handle is designed to be used
 * by Truffle guest language implementations. The Truffle context can be used to create inner
 * contexts for isolated execution of guest language code.
 * <p>
 * A {@link TruffleContext context} consists of a {@link TruffleLanguage#createContext(Env) language
 * context} instance for each {@link Env#getInternalLanguages() installed language}. The current
 * language context is {@link TruffleLanguage#createContext(Env) created} eagerly and can be
 * accessed using a {@link ContextReference context reference} after the context was
 * {@link TruffleContext#enter(Node) entered}.
 * <p>
 * The configuration for each language context is inherited from its parent/creator context. In
 * addition to that {@link Builder#config(String, Object) config} parameters can be passed to new
 * language context instance of the current language. The configuration of other installed languages
 * cannot be modified. To run guest language code in a context, the context needs to be first
 * {@link #enter(Node) entered} and then {@link #leave(Node, Object) left}. The context should be
 * {@link #close() closed} when it is no longer needed. If the context is not closed explicitly,
 * then it is automatically closed together with the parent context.
 * <p>
 * Example usage: {@link TruffleContextSnippets.MyNode#executeInContext}
