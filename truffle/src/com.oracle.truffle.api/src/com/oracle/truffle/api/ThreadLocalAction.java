/**
 * Represents an action that is executed at a {@link TruffleSafepoint safepoint} location of the
 * guest language execution. Thread local actions can be submitted by
 * {@link TruffleLanguage.Env#submitThreadLocal(Thread[], ThreadLocalAction) languages} or
 * {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.instrumentation.TruffleInstrument.Env#submitThreadLocal(TruffleContext, Thread[], ThreadLocalAction)
 * instruments}. When an action is submitted it will be {@link #perform(Access) performed} locally
 * on the threads they are submitted to. After submitting a thread local action a {@link Future} is
 * returned that allows to wait for and cancel the submitted action.
 * <p>
 * Thread local actions can be configured to allow side-effects using the constructor of the action.
 * If side-effects are allowed (<code>true</code>), then the thread-local action is allowed to throw
 * non-internal guest language exceptions from the action and modify the observable guest
 * application state. Otherwise, the action is not allowed to modify the observable state, and any
 * non-internal guest language exception will be transformed to an internal error of type
 * {@link AssertionError}. Side-effects may be temporarily
 * {@link TruffleSafepoint#setAllowSideEffects(boolean) disabled} by the guest language.
 * <p>
 * Thread local actions can also be set to be executed in a synchronous or asynchronous way. A
 * submitted synchronous thread-local action waits until it is started on all threads that it was
 * submitted on. Then the action is {@link ThreadLocalAction#perform(Access) performed} on all
 * threads. After they were performed on a thread, the action waits for all threads to complete. No
 * synchronous thread-local actions can be submitted while performing synchronous actions, as this
 * may lead to deadlocks. If a synchronous event is submitted during a synchronous event, then a
 * {@link IllegalStateException} is thrown when the action is submitted. Asynchronous thread-local
 * actions might start and complete to perform independently of each other. There is no restriction
 * on how they may be submitted.
 * <p>
 * Thread local actions are guaranteed to be executed in the same order as they were submitted for a
 * context. If a context has pending thread-local actions, the actions may be canceled when the
 * context is canceled or closed invalid. Exceptions thrown by the action will be forwarded handled
 * by the guest language implementation. The only exception is for truffle exceptions that are
 * thrown for non-side-effecting events.
 * <p>
 * Example Usage:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Env env; // language or instrument environment
 *
 * env.submitThreadLocal(null, new ThreadLocalAction(true, true) {
 *     &#64;Override
 *     protected void perform(Access access) {
 *         assert access.getThread() == Thread.currentThread();
 *     }
 *
 *     &#64;Override
 *     protected String name() {
 *        return "MyAction"
 *     }
 *
 * });
 *
 * </pre>
