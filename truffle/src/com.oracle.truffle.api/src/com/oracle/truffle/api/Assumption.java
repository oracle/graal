 * An assumption is a global boolean flag that starts with the value true (i.e., the assumption is
 * valid) and can subsequently be invalidated (using {@link Assumption#invalidate()}). Once
 * invalidated, an assumption can never get valid again. Assumptions can be created using the
 * {@link TruffleRuntime#createAssumption()} or the {@link TruffleRuntime#createAssumption(String)}
 * method. The Truffle compiler has special knowledge of this class in order to produce efficient
 * machine code for checking an assumption in case the assumption object is a compile time constant.
 * Therefore, assumptions should be stored in final fields in Truffle nodes.
 *
 * All instances of classes implementing {@code Assumption} must be held in {@code final} fields for
 * compiler optimizations to take effect.
 * <p>
 * Do not manually subclass the {@link Assumption} interface. This class is only intended to be
 * subclassed by Truffle runtime implementations to avoid polymorphism in performance sensitive
 * methods.
