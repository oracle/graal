/**
 * Declares a custom yield operation. A custom yield operation has the same control flow behaviour
 * as the {@link GenerateBytecode#enableYield built-in yield}, but allows to customize the result
 * produced. For example, a custom yield can create a guest generator object instead of a
 * {@link ContinuationResult}, or it can perform custom logic before
 * {@link ContinuationResult#create(ContinuationRootNode, MaterializedFrame, Object) creating} the
 * continuation result.
 * <p>
 * Below is an example of a custom yield that returns a guest language generator object:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Yield
 * public static final class CustomYield {
 *     &#64;Specialization
 *     public static Object doYield(Object value, &#64;Bind ContinuationRootNode root, &#64;Bind MaterializedFrame frame) {
 *         return new MyGeneratorObject(root, frame, value);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * A custom yield operation has many of the same restrictions and capabilities of a regular
 * {@link Operation}, with a few differences:
 * <ul>
 * <li>It must take zero or one dynamic operand.</li>
 * <li>It yields a value to the caller, so it must have a return value. The result should be a
 * {@link InteropLibrary#isValidValue valid interop type}. Typically, the result should encapsulate
 * the continuation state so that the callee can resume execution at a later time.</li>
 * <li>It can {@link Bind} a {@link ContinuationRootNode} operand, which can be used to resume
 * execution at a later time. (Custom yields will typically also {@link Bind} the
 * {@link MaterializedFrame} to capture the interpreter state, but this is possible in regular
 * operations.)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Note that {@link GenerateBytecode#enableYield} does not need to be {@code true} to use custom
 * yields; it is only necessary if you need the built-in yield operation. The built-in yield
 * operation is semantically equivalent to the following custom yield operation:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Yield
 * public static final class BuiltinYield {
 *     &#64;Specialization
 *     public static Object doYield(Object result, &#64;Bind ContinuationRootNode root, &#64;Bind MaterializedFrame frame) {
 *         return ContinuationResult.create(root, frame, result);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>

 * @see GenerateBytecode#enableYield()
