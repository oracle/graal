/**
 * Declares an operation. An operation serves as a specification for a bytecode instruction in the
 * generated interpreter.
 *
 * An operation class is declared the same way as a regular Truffle AST node, with a few
 * differences:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The class should be nested inside the bytecode root node class.
 * <li>The class should be declared {@code public static final}. It should not extend/implement any
 * other class/interface.
 * <li>The class should not contain instance members.
 * <li>The class's specializations also have some differences:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Specializations must all have the same arity (with respect to non-special parameters). The
 * parameters of any {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.dsl.Fallback} specialization must be of type
 * {@link Object}.
 * <li>Specializations should be {@code public static}. Any members referenced in DSL expressions
 * (e.g., {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.dsl.Cached @Cached} parameters) should also be
 * {@code static} and visible to the bytecode root node class.
 * <li>Specializations can declare additional special parameters (e.g., {@link LocalSetter}). They
 * can also bind some special parameters (e.g., {@code @Bind("$root")}).
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Refer to the <a href=
 * "https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/truffle/docs/bytecode_dsl/UserGuide.md">user
 * guide</a> for more details.
