/**
 * Represents a dynamic object, members of which can be dynamically added and removed at run time.
 *
 * To use it, extend {@link DynamicObject} and use {@link DynamicObjectLibrary} for object accesses.
 *
 * When {@linkplain DynamicObject#DynamicObject(Shape) constructing} a {@link DynamicObject}, it has
 * to be initialized with an empty initial shape. Initial shapes are created using
 * {@link Shape#newBuilder()} and should ideally be shared per TruffleLanguage instance to allow
 * shape caches to be shared across contexts.
 *
 * Subclasses can provide in-object dynamic field slots using the {@link DynamicField} annotation
 * and {@link Shape.Builder#layout(Class) Shape.Builder.layout}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * public class MyObject extends DynamicObject implements TruffleObject {
 *     public MyObject(Shape shape) {
 *         super(shape);
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * Shape initialShape = Shape.newBuilder().layout(MyObject.class).build();
 *
 * MyObject obj = new MyObject(initialShape);
 * </code>
