/**
 * Creates a new weak reference that is safe to be used in compiled code paths. If a weak reference
 * is {@link CompilerDirectives#isPartialEvaluationConstant(Object) PE constant} then the
 * {@link #get() referenced object} will be
 * {@link CompilerDirectives#isPartialEvaluationConstant(Object) PE constant} as well.
 * <p>
 * When a language is compiled using native-image then a closed world closure of all runtime
 * compiled methods is computed. That list of methods can rely on static type information only. If
 * the host application or any of the loaded libraries uses custom weak reference sub-classes that
 * were not designed for partial evaluation then these method will be listed as runtime compilable
 * methods, causing black listed method errors at native-image compilation time. To avoid this
 * problem use this custom weak reference subclass which is designed for PE if used as exact class
 * of the field.
 * <p>
 * <b>Wrong usage</b> of weak references in compiled code paths:
 *

 * class MyNode extends Node {

 *
 *     Object execute(Object arg) {
 *         if (reference == null) {

 *             reference = new WeakReference&lt;&gt;(arg);
