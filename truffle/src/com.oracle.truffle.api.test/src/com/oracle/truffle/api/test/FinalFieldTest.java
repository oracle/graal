/**
 * <h3>Using Final Fields in Node Classes</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * The usage of final fields in node classes is highly encouraged. It is beneficial for performance
 * to declare every field that is not pointing to a child node as final. This gives the Truffle
 * runtime an increased opportunity to optimize this node.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If a node has a value which may change at run time, but will rarely do so, it is recommended to
 * speculate on the field being final. This involves starting executing with a node where this field
 * is final and only if this turns out to be no longer the case, the node is replaced with an
 * alternative implementation of the operation (see {@link ReplaceTest}).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The next part of the Truffle API introduction is at
 * {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.test.ReplaceTest}.
 * </p>
