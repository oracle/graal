/**
 * <h3>Passing Arguments</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * When invoking a call target with {@link CallTarget#call(Object[])}, arguments can be passed. A
 * Truffle node can access the arguments passed into the Truffle method by using
 * {@link VirtualFrame#getArguments}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The arguments class should only contain fields that are declared as final. This allows the
 * Truffle runtime to improve optimizations around guest language method calls. Also, the arguments
 * object array must never be stored into a field. It should be created immediately before invoking
 * {@link CallTarget#call(Object[])} and no longer be accessed afterwards.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The next part of the Truffle API introduction is at {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.test.FrameTest}
 * .
 * </p>
