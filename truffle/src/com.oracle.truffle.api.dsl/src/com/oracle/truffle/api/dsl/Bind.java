/**
 * Binds and executes an expression at most once for every execution of the node. This is useful if
 * an expression cannot be repeated safely for a guard and its associated specialization method. For
 * example, if a read of a field is volatile two consecutive reads might not lead to the same
 * result. The name the extract parameter can be referred to in {@link Cached cached},
 * {@link Specialization#guards() guard}, {@link Specialization#limit() limit},
 * {@link Specialization#assumptions() assumption} expressions or the specialization body. The bind
 * expression may refer to dynamic parameters, previously declared bind or cached parameters and
 * {@link NodeField node field} declarations.
 * <p>
 * If a bind parameter only uses cached values, then it is considered also a cached value. If the
 * parameter uses any dynamic parameter then the extract parameter is considered also a dynamic
 * parameter.
 * <p>
 * Usage examples:
 *
 * <pre>
 * static class DynamicObject {
 *
 *     volatile Object storage;
 *
 *     DynamicObject(Object storage) {
 *         this.storage = storage;
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * abstract static class ExtractStorageNode extends Node {
 *
 *     abstract Object execute(Object arg0);
 *
 *     &#64;Specialization(guards = "storage == cachedStorage", limit = "3")
 *     Object s0(DynamicObject a0,
 *                     &#64;Bind("a0.storage") Object storage,
 *                     &#64;Cached("storage") Object cachedStorage) {
 *         // use storage in specialization and in guard.
 *         return a0;
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The special variable {@code $node} can be used to bind the current node. Bytecode DSL
 * interpreters can also bind the special variables {@code $rootNode}, {@code $bytecodeNode}, and
 * {@code $bytecodeIndex}.
