/**
 * <p>
 * A method annotated with {@link Fallback} is treated as a {@link Specialization} that implicitly
 * links all the guards of all other declared {@link Specialization} annotated methods of the
 * operation in a negated form. As a consequence it cannot declare any other guards. The expected
 * signature of the method must match to the signature of a {@link Specialization} with the
 * additional limitation that only generically executable argument types are allowed. A generically
 * executable argument is an argument that can be executed from the child {@link Node} using an
 * execute method without {@link UnsupportedOperationException}. In many cases the generically
 * executable type is {@link Object}. An operation is limited to just one {@link Fallback}
 * specialization which is always ordered at the end of the specialization chain.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A simple example showing the use of the {@link Fallback} annotation in a DSL operation:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#064;Specialization int doInt(int a) {..}
 * &#064;Specialization int doDouble(double a) {..}
 * &#064;Fallback int orElse(Object a) {..}
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The previous example could be redeclared just using {@link Specialization} annotated methods as
 * follows:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#064;Specialization int doInt(int a) {..}
 * &#064;Specialization int doDouble(double a) {..}
 * &#064;Specialization(guard={"!isInt(a)", "!isDouble(a)"})
 * int orElse(Object a) {..}
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Performance note:</b> For operations with a lot of {@link Specialization} annotated methods
 * the use of {@link Fallback} might generate a guard that is very big. Try to avoid the use of
 * {@link Fallback} for specializations that are significantly important for peak performance.
 * </p>
 *
 * Fallback annotated methods support {@link Cached}, {@link Bind}, {@link CachedContext},
 * {@link CachedLanguage} and dispatched {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.library.CachedLibrary}.
