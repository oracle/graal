/**
 * <p>
 * Defines a method of a node subclass to represent one specialization of an operation. Multiple
 * specializations can be defined in a node representing an operation. A specialization defines
 * which kind of input is expected using the method signature and the annotation attributes. The
 * specialized semantics of the operation are defined using the body of the annotated Java method. A
 * specialization method must be declared in a class that is derived from {@link Node} that
 * references a {@link TypeSystem}. At least one specialization must be defined per operation. If no
 * specialization is valid for the given set of input values then an
 * {@link UnsupportedSpecializationException} is thrown instead of invoking any specialization
 * method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A specialization must have at least as many parameters as there are {@link NodeChild} annotations
 * declared for the enclosing operation node. These parameters are declared in the same order as the
 * {@link NodeChild} annotations (linear execution order). We call such parameters dynamic input
 * parameters. Every specialization that is declared within an operation must have an equal number
 * of dynamic input parameters.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The supported kind of input values for a specialization are declared using guards. A
 * specialization may provide declarative specifications for four kinds of guards:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Type guards</b> optimistically assume the type of an input value. A value that matches the
 * type is cast to its expected type automatically. Type guards are modeled using the parameter type
 * of the specialization method. Types used for type guards must be defined in the
 * {@link TypeSystem}. If the type of the parameter is {@link Object} then no type guard is used for
 * the dynamic input parameter.</li>
 *
 * <li><b>Expression guards</b> optimistically assume the return value of a user-defined expression
 * to be <code>true</code>. Expression guards are modeled using Java expressions that return a
 * <code>boolean</code> value. If the guard expression returns <code>false</code>, the
 * specialization is no longer applicable and the operation is re-specialized. Guard expressions are
 * declared using the {@link #guards()} attribute.</li>
 *
 * <li><b>Event guards</b> trigger re-specialization in case an exception is thrown in the
 * specialization body. The {@link #rewriteOn()} attribute can be used to declare a list of such
 * exceptions. Guards of this kind are useful to avoid calculating a value twice when it is used in
 * the guard and its specialization.</li>
 *
 * <li><b>Assumption guards</b> optimistically assume that the state of an {@link Assumption}
 * remains <code>true</code>. Assumptions can be assigned to specializations using the
 * {@link #assumptions()} attribute.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The enclosing {@link Node} of a specialization method must have at least one <code>public</code>
 * and non-<code>final</code> execute method. An execute method is a method that starts with
 * 'execute'. If all execute methods declare the first parameter type as {@link Frame},
 * {@link VirtualFrame} or {@link MaterializedFrame} then the same frame type can be used as
 * optional first parameter of the specialization. This parameter does not count to the number of
 * dynamic parameters.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A specialization method may declare multiple parameters annotated with {@link Cached}. Cached
 * parameters are initialized and stored once per specialization instantiation. For consistency
 * between specialization declarations cached parameters must be declared last in a specialization
 * method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the operation is re-specialized or if it is executed for the first time then all declared
 * specializations of the operation are tried in declaration order until the guards of the first
 * specialization accepts the current input values. The new specialization is then added to the
 * chain of current specialization instances which might consist of one (monomorph) or multiple
 * instances (polymorph). If an assumption of an instantiated specialization is violated then
 * re-specialization is triggered again.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * With guards in combination with cached parameters it is possible that multiple instances of the
 * same specialization are created. The {@link #limit()} attribute can be used to limit the number
 * of instantiations per specialization.
