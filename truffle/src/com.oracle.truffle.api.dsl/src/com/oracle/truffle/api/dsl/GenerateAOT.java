/**
 * Allows nodes with specializations to be prepared for AOT. The annotation is automatically
 * inherited by all subclasses. Specializations of annotated nodes will be validated for their
 * suitability for AOT preparation. By default all specializations that are not
 * {@link Specialization#replaces() replaced} by an AOT capable specializations are included for AOT
 * validation and preparation. If a specialization is not suitable a compilation error will be
 * shown.
 * <p>
 * The following properties make a specialization incapable of being used for AOT preparation:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Dynamic parameters bound in cached initializers. At AOT preparation time no dynamic
 * parameters are available, therefore the the caches not be initialized. Values read from the node
 * instance or from a {@link CachedLanguage} of the {@link RootNode#getLanguage(Class) root
 * language} are supported.
 * <li>If a Truffle library is used that is automatically dispatched or where the expression
 * initializer is bound to a dynamic parameter value.
 * <li>If a cached node is created that does not itself support {@link GenerateAOT}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Additionally, to resolve compilation errors related to AOT the following resolutions may be
 * applied:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Exclude this specialization from AOT with {@link Exclude}, if it is acceptable to deoptimize
 * for this specialization in AOT compiled code.
 * <li>Configure the specialization to be {@link Specialization#replaces()} with a more generic
 * specialization.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * After a node generates code for AOT preparation {@link AOTSupport#prepareForAOT(RootNode)} may be
 * used to prepare a root node in {@link RootNode#prepareForAOT}.
 * <p>
 * This annotation can also be used for classes annotated with Truffle library declarations and
 * exports. The same rules, as described here, for specializations declared in exported libraries
 * apply. Multiple AOT exports may be specified for each library, but there must be at least one,
 * otherwise an {@link IllegalStateException} is thrown at runtime when AOT is prepared.
 *
 * <p>
 * See also the <a href= "https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/truffle/docs/AOT.md">usage
 * tutorial</a> on the website.
