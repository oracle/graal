/**
 * <p>
 * A profile is a Truffle utility class that uses the {@link CompilerDirectives Truffle compiler
 * directives} to guard for and/or forward runtime information to the compiler.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage:</b> Profiles should be stored in <code>final</code> or {@link CompilationFinal
 * compilation final} fields of node classes to ensure that they can get optimized properly.
 * Profiles must not be shared between ASTs. Using the same profile multiple times in a single
 * {@link Node node} or in multiple {@link Node nodes} which {@link Node#getRootNode() link} to the
 * same {@link RootNode root} is allowed. <b>Never</b> store profiles inside runtime values that
 * leave the scope of the originating AST. This limitation exists because the used mechanism to
 * invalidate compiled code performs local invalidations only. For global speculations use
 * {@link Assumption assumptions} instead.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Compilation:</b> Some profiles like {@link BranchProfile branch} profiles do not induce
 * additional overhead in compiled code. Others like {@link ValueProfile value} profiles might
 * require a runtime check to verify their assumptions which are forwarded to the compiler. Even if
 * profiles do not induce direct overhead in compiled code it still might get invalidated as a
 * result of using profiles. Invalidating profiles will result in the invalidation of compiled code.
 * It is therefore essential to place these profiles in way that is neither too aggressive nor too
 * conservative.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Footprint:</b> Whether profiling information can be forwarded to the compiler depends on the
 * capabilities of the {@link TruffleRuntime runtime system}. If the runtime returns
 * <code>true</code> in {@link TruffleRuntime#isProfilingEnabled()} then runtime information will
 * get collected. This comes at at the cost of additional overhead and footprint in interpreted
 * mode. Thats why the factory methods of profiles can return implementations where profiling is
 * disabled. Using disabled profiles makes sense for runtimes that are unable to use the collected
 * profiling information. Even runtime implementations that are able to use this information might
 * decide to turn off profiling for benchmarking purposes.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Profile subclasses:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link BranchProfile} to profile on unlikely branches like errors.</li>
 * <li>{@link ConditionProfile} to profile on conditionals or boolean values.</li>
 * <li>{@link LoopConditionProfile} to profile on conditionals of loops with special support for
 * counted loops.</li>
 * <li>{@link ValueProfile} to profile on properties like type and identity of values.</li>
 * <li>{@link ByteValueProfile} to profile on <code>byte</code> values.</li>
 * <li>{@link IntValueProfile} to profile on <code>int</code> values.</li>
 * <li>{@link LongValueProfile} to profile on <code>long</code> values.</li>
 * <li>{@link FloatValueProfile} to profile on <code>float</code> values.</li>
 * <li>{@link DoubleValueProfile} to profile on <code>double</code> values.</li>
 * <li>{@link PrimitiveValueProfile} to profile on objects by identity and on primitives by value.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
