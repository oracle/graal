/**
 * <p>
 * Specialized value profile to capture certain properties of <code>long</code> runtime values.
 * Value profiles require a runtime check in their initialized state to verify their profiled
 * assumption. Value profiles are limited to capture monomorphic profiles only. This means that if
 * two or more values are profiled within a single profile then the profile has no effect. If the
 * value assumption is invalidated in compiled code then it is invalidated.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b> Usage example: </b>
 *
 * <pre>
 * class SampleNode extends Node {
 *
 *     final LongValueProfile profile = LongValueProfile.createIdentityProfile();
 *
 *     long execute(long input) {
 *         long profiledValue = profile.profile(input);
 *         // compiler may know now more about profiledValue
 *         return profiledValue;
 *     }
