/**
 * Truffle Libraries allow language implementations to use polymorphic dispatch for receiver types
 * with support for implementation specific caching/profiling and customization of the dispatch.
 * Libraries enable modularity and encapsulation for representation types in language
 * implementations.
 * <p>
 * Before reading the javadoc make sure you have read the
 * <a href= "https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/truffle/docs/TruffleLibraries.md">tutorial
 * </a>.
 * <p>
 * Start learning Truffle Libraries by reading the following articles:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link com.oracle.truffle.api.library.GenerateLibrary Libraries} specify the set of available
 * messages i.e. the protocol.
 * <li>{@link com.oracle.truffle.api.library.ExportLibrary Exports} implement a library for a
 * receiver type.
 * <li>Automatic dispatching using
 * {@linkplain com.oracle.truffle.api.library.CachedLibrary @CachedLibrary} allows to call library
 * messages with concrete receiver and parameters from nodes using the
 * {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.dsl.Specialization specialization} DSL.
 * <li>Manual dispatching using the {@linkplain com.oracle.truffle.api.library.LibraryFactory
 * LibraryFactory} allows to perform slow-path calls and custom inline cache implementations.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Advanced Features:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.library.ReflectionLibrary} allows to reflectively export
 * and call messages without binary dependency to a library. It also allows to implement library
 * agnostic proxies.
 * <li>The {@link com.oracle.truffle.api.library.DynamicDispatchLibrary} allows to implement
 * receivers that dynamically dispatch to exported message implementations.
 * </ul>
 *
 * @see com.oracle.truffle.api.library.GenerateLibrary To specify libraries
 * @see com.oracle.truffle.api.library.ExportLibrary To export libraries
 * @see com.oracle.truffle.api.library.CachedLibrary To dispatch libraries from nodes
 * @see com.oracle.truffle.api.library.LibraryFactory To manually dispatch messages
 * @since 19.0
