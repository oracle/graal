/**
 * Libraries are specified with <code>public</code> and <code>abstract</code> Java classes that
 * extend the {@linkplain Library} class and are annotated by <code>@GenerateLibrary</code>. A
 * library consists of a set of messages, that are specified using public Java methods. The methods
 * may be abstract or use default implementations. The first parameter of every library message is
 * the receiver parameter, which must be a non-primitive type and consistent across all messages of
 * a library. There are no restrictions on the return type or argument types of a message. Every
 * method that specifies a message must have a name that is unique per library. Final or private
 * methods will always be ignored by the generator. Parameter type overloading is currently not
 * supported for messages, therefore every public method must have a unique name per library.
 * Generic type arguments local to messages are generally supported, but generic type arguments on
 * the library type are not yet supported.
 * <p>
 *
 * <h3>Basic Usage</h3>
 *
 * The following example specifies a basic library for arrays:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;GenerateLibrary
 * public abstract class ArrayLibrary extends Library {
 *
 *     public boolean isArray(Object receiver) {
 *         return false;
 *     }
 *
 *     public abstract int read(Object receiver, int index);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Messages that are not implemented and have no default implementation throw an
 * {@link AbstractMethodError}. The {@link Abstract} annotation can be used, to provide a default
 * implementation for receiver types but at the same time make the message abstract.
 * <p>
 * A library class may also specify {@link DefaultExport default exports} that can be used to
 * dispatch to receiver types that don't export the library. Since the receiver type for default
 * exports can be specified explicitly, it can be used to provide a default implementation for
 * receiver types of third parties or the JDK. For example the Truffle interop library has default
 * exports for most {@link Number} types, {@link String} and {@link Boolean} type.
 * <p>
 * In order to enable AOT generation for a a library annotate the class with {@link GenerateAOT} and
 * enable exports to be used for AOT by setting {@link ExportLibrary#useForAOT()} to
 * <code>true</code>.
 *
 * @see DefaultExport to specify default exports.
 * @see Abstract to make messages abstract if they have a default implemetnation
 * @since 19.0
