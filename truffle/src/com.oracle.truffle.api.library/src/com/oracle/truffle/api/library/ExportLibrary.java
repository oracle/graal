/**
 * Allows to export messages of Truffle libraries. The exported library {@link ExportLibrary#value()
 * value} specifies the library class that is exported. If there are abstract methods specified by a
 * library then those messages need to be implemented. A receiver may export multiple libraries at
 * the same time, by specifying multiple export annotations. Subclasses of the receiver type inherit
 * all exported messages and may also be exported again. In this case the subclass overrides the
 * base class export.
 *
 * <h3>Method Exports</h3>
 *
 * Messages are exported by specifying methods annotated by
 * {@linkplain ExportMessage @ExportMessage} that match the name and signature of a library message.
 * By default the message name is inferred by the method name and the library is automatically
 * detected if it can be unambiguously identified by its simple name. If the receiver type is
 * implicit then the receiver type parameter can be omitted. Exported messages allow the use of
 * {@linkplain Cached} and {@linkplain CachedLibrary} parameters at the end of the method. This
 * allows the use of nodes in implementations.
 *
 * <p>
 * <h4>Usage example</h4>
 *
 * Example usage with implicit receiver type:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;ExportLibrary(ArrayLibrary.class)
 * static final class BufferArray {
 *
 *     private int length;
 *     private int[] buffer;
 *
 *     BufferArray(int length) {
 *         this.length = length;
 *         this.buffer = new int[length];
 *     }
 *
 *     &#64;ExportMessage
 *     boolean isArray() {
 *         return true;
 *     }
 *
 *     &#64;ExportMessage
 *     int read(int index) {
 *         return buffer[index];
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Class exports</h3>
 *
 * If a message export requires more than one {@link Specialization specialization} then the export
 * must be specified as class. In this case the simple name of the message is resolved by using the
 * class name and turning the first character lower-case. So for an exported class named
 * <code>Read</code> the message <code>read</code> would be used. It is not allowed to use a method
 * export and a class export for the same message at the same time. Multiple {@link ExportMessage}
 * annotations may be used for the same method or class to export them for multiple messages. In
 * this case the {@link ExportMessage#name() message name} needs to be specified explicitly and the
 * target signatures need to match for all exported messages.
 *
 * <p>
 * <h4>Usage example</h4>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;ExportLibrary(value = ArrayLibrary.class)
 * static final class SequenceArray {
 *
 *     final int start;
 *     final int stride;
 *     final int length;
 *
 *     SequenceArray(int start, int stride, int length) {
 *         this.start = start;
 *         this.stride = stride;
 *         this.length = length;
 *     }
 *
 *     &#64;ExportMessage
 *     boolean isArray() {
 *         return true;
 *     }
 *
 *     &#64;ExportMessage
 *     static class Read {
 *         &#64;Specialization(guards = {"seq.stride == cachedStride",
 *                         "seq.start  == cachedStart"}, limit = "1")
 *         static int doSequenceCached(SequenceArray seq, int index,
 *                         &#64;Cached("seq.start") int cachedStart,
 *                         &#64;Cached("seq.stride") int cachedStride) {
 *             return cachedStart + cachedStride * index;
 *         }
 *
 *         &#64;Specialization(replaces = "doSequenceCached")
 *         static int doSequence(SequenceArray seq, int index) {
 *             return doSequenceCached(seq, index, seq.start, seq.stride);
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Explicit Receiver Types</h3>
 *
 * For {@link DefaultExport default exports} or types that support {@link DynamicDispatchLibrary
 * dynamic dispatch} the export may declare an {@link #receiverType() explicit receiver type}.

 * @see CachedLibrary
