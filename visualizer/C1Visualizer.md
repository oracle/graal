# Readme for C1Visualizer


# Developing the C1Visualizer

C1Visualizer is based on Netbeans 26 but can be often be worked on with later releases or with any
IDE that supports Maven.  Care must be taken not to commmit anything that would keep it from working
with 26 so any automatic changes to property file updates by later NetBeans versions shouldn't be
pushed.  The packaged product is built by:
```
cd C1Visualizer
mvn package
```

# Regenerating the cfg file parser

The cfg file parser is based on CoCo/R which hasn't been updated since 2018 and doesn't support
large files.  For simplicity, it has been checked in and some bugs with handling of large files were
fixed.  It can be regenerated by getting Coco.jar from https://ssw.jku.at/Research/Projects/Coco and
running the following command line.  Note that still will overwrite any locals fixes but this should
never be necessary.

```
java -jar Coco.jar -o CompilationModel/src/main/java/at/ssw/visualizer/parser \
            -package at.ssw.visualizer.parser CompilationModel/src/main/java/at/ssw/visualizer/parser/CompilerOutput.atg
```

# Releasing a new version

As this is now maven based, `mvn -B release:prepare` is used to update to new versions which will automatically bump the module versions.

The resulting zip file will be in `C1Visualizer/application/target`.
