        ### How to Find and Share the `svm_err_b_*.md` File

        When a native image build fails fatally, GraalVM generates a detailed error report file with a name like `svm_err_b_<timestamp>_<pid>.md`. This file contains valuable information for diagnosing the issue.

        Use -H:ErrorFile to adjust the path or filename.

        Once located, please attach this file to the issue report. You can also provide a link to the file if it is hosted in a shared location.
