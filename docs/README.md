# How to Contribute to GraalVM Documentation

The GraalVM documentation is open source and anyone can contribute to make it perfect and comprehensive.

The GraalVM documentation is presented in the form of:
* reference documentation which includes getting started and user guides, reference manuals, examples, security guidelines
* Javadoc APIS documentation for application developers, or those who write Java compatibility tests or seek to re-implement the GraalVM platform

Here you will find most of the GraalVM documentation sources, in the same hierarchy as displayed on the [GraalVM website](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/introduction/).
The Truffle framework documentation can be found in the [graal/truffle/docs](https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/truffle/docs) folder.
GraalVM languages implementations are being developed and tested in separate from the GraalVM core repositories, so their user documentation can be found in:

* [GraalJS](https://github.com/oracle/graaljs/tree/master/docs/user) - JavaScript and Node.js
* [FastR](https://github.com/oracle/fastr/tree/master/documentation/user) - R
* [GraalPython](https://github.com/oracle/graalpython/tree/master/docs/user) - Python
* [TruffleRuby](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/tree/master/doc/user) - Ruby
