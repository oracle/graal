# Installation on macOS Platforms

GraalVM Enterprise can be installed for a single user and administrator privileges are not required. However, if GraalVM Enterprise is meant to become a default JDK, administrator privileges are required.

GraalVM Enterprise does not provide the installation wizard, unlike Oracle JDK distributions for macOS that come with the _.dmg_ download.
Note that in macOS, the JDK installation path is: `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/<graalvm>/Contents/Home`.

Follow these steps to install Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition on the macOS operating system:

1. Navigate to[ Oracle GraalVM Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/downloads/graalvm-downloads.html).
2. Select the preferable GraalVM Enterprise version in the Release Version dropdown, **11** or **17** for the Java version, and **macOS** for the operating system.
3. Click on the **GraalVM Enterprise Core** download link. Before you download a file, you must accept the [Oracle License Agreement](https://www.oracle.com/downloads/licenses/graalvm-otn-license.html) in the popup window.
4. When the download button becomes active, press it to start downloading **graalvm-ee-java<version>-darvin-amd64-<version>.tar.gz**.
5. Unzip the archive:
  ```shell
  tar -xzf graalvm-ee-java<version>-darvin-amd64-<version>.tar.gz
  ```
  Alternatively, open the file in Finder.
  > Note: If you are using macOS Catalina and later you may need to remove the quarantine attribute. See [Installation Notes](#installation-notes) below.

6. Move the downloaded package to its proper location, the `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines` directory. Since this is a system directory, `sudo` is required:
  ```shell
  sudo mv graalvm-ee-java<version>-<version> /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines
  ```
To verify if the move is successful and to get a list of all installed JDKs, run `/usr/libexec/java_home -V`.
7. There can be multiple JDKs installed on the machine. The next step is to configure the runtime environment:
  - Point the `PATH` environment variable to the GraalVM Enterprise `bin` directory:
    ```shell
    export PATH=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/<graalvm>/Contents/Home/bin:$PATH
    ```
  - Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to resolve to the GraalVM Enterprise installation directory:
    ```shell
    export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/<graalvm>/Contents/Home
    ```
8. To check whether the installation was successful, run the `java -version` command.

Optionally, you can specify GraalVM Enterprise as the default JRE or JDK installation in your Java IDE.

## Installation Notes

#### On Software Notarization
If you are using macOS Catalina and later you may need to remove the quarantine attribute from the bits before you can use them.
To do this, run the following:
```shell
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/GRAALVM_HOME
```

#### On JAVA_HOME Command
The information property file, _Info.plist_, is in the top level _Contents_ folder.
This means that GraalVM Enterprise participates in the macOS-specific `/usr/libexec/java_home` mechanism. Depending on other JDK 8 installation(s) available, it is now possible that `/usr/libexec/java_home -v1.8` returns `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/<graalvm>/Contents/Home`.
You can run `/usr/libexec/java_home -v1.8 -V` to see the complete list of 1.8 JVMs available to the `java_home` command. This command sorts the JVMs in decreasing version order and chooses the top one as the default for the specified version.
Within a specific version, the sort order appears to be stable but is unspecified.

## Supported Functionalities

The base distribution of GraalVM Enterprise for macOS platforms includes Oracle JDK with the GraalVM compiler enabled, LLVM and JavaScript runtimes.
The base installation can be extended with:

Tools/Utilities:
* [Native Image](../../reference-manual/native-image/README.md) -- a technology to compile an application ahead-of-time into a native executable
* [LLVM toolchain](../../reference-manual/llvm/Compiling.md#llvm-toolchain-for-compiling-cc) --  a set of tools and APIs for compiling native programs to bitcode that can be executed with on the GraalVM runtime

Runtimes:
* [Java on Truffle](../../reference-manual/java-on-truffle/README.md) -- a Java Virtual Machine implementation based on a Truffle interpreter for GraalVM
* [Node.js](../../reference-manual/js/README.md) -- Node.js v14.18.1 compatible
* [Python](../../reference-manual/python/README.md) -- Python 3.8.5 compatible
* [Ruby](../../reference-manual/ruby/README.md) -- Ruby 3.0.2 compatible
* [R](/../../reference-manual/r/README.md) -- GNU R 4.0.3 compatible
* [Wasm](../../reference-manual/wasm/README.md) -- WebAssembly (Wasm)
â€‹
These runtimes are not part of the GraalVM Enterprise base distribution and must be installed separately.

To assist a user with installation, GraalVM includes **GraalVM Updater**, a command line utility to install and manage additional functionalities.
Proceed to the [installation steps](../../reference-manual/graalvm-updater.md#component-installation) to add any necessary language runtime or utility from above to GraalVM.
