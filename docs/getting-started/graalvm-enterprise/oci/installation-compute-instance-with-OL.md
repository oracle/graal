# Oracle GraalVM on OCI Compute Instances with Oracle Linux

This guide describes how to install Oracle GraalVM on an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Compute instance with Oracle Linux 7,8, and 9.
For users who prefer a Bare Metal Machine instance, see [this documentation](https://cloud.oracle.com/iaas/whitepapers/deploying_custom_os_images.pdf).
For complete beginners, [start with this tutorial to create and launch your first Linux instance](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Reference/overviewworkflow.htm?tocpath=Getting%20Started%7CTutorial%20-%20Launching%20Your%20First%20Linux%20Instance%7C_____0).

> Note: [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)](https://www.oracle.com/cloud) provides Oracle GraalVM to its customers for free. Oracle
GraalVM support is included in an Oracle Cloud subscription.

### Prerequisites

To replicate the steps in this guide, [create a Compute instance and connect to it](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Reference/overviewworkflow.htm?tocpath=Getting%20Started%7CTutorial%20-%20Launching%20Your%20First%20Linux%20Instance%7C_____0).

## Install Oracle GraalVM

For convenience, Oracle GraalVM RPMs are available in the Oracle YUM repository. 
Each RPM is self-contained and will automatically pull in all required dependencies.

That means that OCI customers can use the Oracle GraalVM environment in their compute instances by installing it with `yum`&emdash;a package-management utility for the Linux operating system.

The following instructions have been tested on an OCI Compute Instance with **Oracle Linux 7.9** and **VM.Standard.E4.Flex** with 1 OCPU and 16 GB RAM.
Use the following command to connect to the OCI Compute Instance from a Unix-style system:

   ```shell
   ssh -i .ssh/id_rsa opc@INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP
   ```

`.ssh/id_rsa` is the full path and name of the file containing your private SSH key; `opc` is the default name for the Oracle Linux image; and `INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP` is the instance IP address provisioned from the console.
For more details, refer to theÂ [Connecting to Your Linux Instance Using SSH](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/GSG/Tasks/testingconnection.htm) tutorial.

1. Having connected to the instance, verify which Oracle GraalVM RPMs are available for the installation, narrowing down the search to the latest release, and Java 17. Use the following command:

   ```shell
   sudo yum provides graalvm22-ee-17-jdk
   ```
   The resulting list includes both current and previous versions of all of the core package and additional features.

2. Find the appropriate RPM package name, and install Oracle GraalVM with `sudo yum install <package_name>`.
For example, to install the latest version of "Oracle GraalVM JDK17 Java Development Kit", run:

   ```shell
   sudo yum install graalvm22-ee-17-jdk
   ```
   Confirm that the installed package size is correct by entering `yes` at the prompt. 
   It will install the latest version of **graalvm22-ee-17-jdk** which includes the JVM runtime with the Graal compiler.

   After the installation, the Oracle GraalVM binary is placed in _/usr/lib64/graalvm_. You can check this with:

   ```shell
   ls /usr/lib64/graalvm
   ```

3. Configure environment variables to point to the Oracle GraalVM installation for this SSH session. After installation, the package files are placed in the _/usr/lib64/graalvm_ directory, and binaries in _bin_ accordingly.

   - Set the `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME` environment variables in the bash configuration to point to Oracle GraalVM with the following commands:

      ```shell
      echo "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib64/graalvm/graalvm22-ee-java17" >> ~/.bashrc
      ```
      
      ```shell
      echo 'export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
      ```
   - Activate this change:

      ```shell
      source ~/.bashrc
      ```

   - Verify the values of `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME`:

      ```shell
      echo $JAVA_HOME
      echo $PATH
      ```
   - Run the following command to confirm the version of Oracle GraalVM installed:

      ```shell
      java -version
      ```

Now you have a ready-to-go OCI Compute instance with Oracle GraalVM installed.

## Install Additional Features

Oracle GraalVM consists of several features and components&emdash;JDK, Native Image, Javascript runtime, and Node.js runtime&emdash;each of which can be installed separately or as an add-on. 
See the [Distribution Components List](https://docs.oracle.com/en/graalvm/jdk/20/docs/support/#certified-platforms) for more information.

To add additional features to Oracle GraalVM, use the `yum install <package_name>` command. 

1. Check what additional features are available for your current Oracle GraalVM installation:

   ```shell
   sudo yum provides graalvm22*
   ```
   The printed list is very large. If you are interested in a particular component, for example, the Python runtime, narrow down the search providing the exact package name:

   ```shell
   sudo yum provides graalvm22-ee-17-python*
   ```

2. Add the component to Oracle GraalVM with the `yum install <package_name> command` command. For example, to install the Python runtime, run:

   ```shell
   sudo yum install graalvm22-ee-17-python
   ```
   Confirm that the installed package size is correct by entering `yes` at the prompt.

### Install Native Image

[Native Image](../../../reference-manual/native-image/README.md) is a technology to turn your Java application into a standalone native executable and has to be added to the Oracle GraalVM JDK installation.

1. Search for Native Image RPMs available for your installation: 

   ```shell
   sudo yum provides graalvm22-ee-17-native-image*
   ```
2. Install Native Image using the `yum install <package_name> command` command. All required dependencies will be automatically resolved.

   - On Oracle Linux 7.9, run:
      ```shell
      # Install newer devtoolset with GCC version 10 (required by Native Image)
      sudo yum -y install oracle-softwarecollection-release-el7
      sudo yum install devtoolset-10
      # Enable the newer devtoolset by default
      echo 'source scl_source enable devtoolset-10' >> ~/.bashrc
      # Enter a new bash session with the newer devtoolset enabled
      bash
      # Install Native Image
      sudo yum install graalvm22-ee-17-native-image
      ```
      Confirm that the installed package size is correct by entering `yes` at the prompt.

   - On Oracle Linux 8 and 9, run these commands one by one:
      ```shell
      sudo yum update -y oraclelinux-release-el8
      sudo yum config-manager --set-enabled ol8_codeready_builder
      sudo yum install graalvm22-ee-17-native-image
      ```
      Confirm that the installed package size is correct by entering `yes` at the prompt.
      
   - On Oracle Linux 8 and 9 with `dnf` or `microdnf` default package managers, run these commands one by one:
      ```shell
      dnf update -y oraclelinux-release-el8
      dnf config-manager --set-enabled ol8_codeready_builder
      dnf install graalvm22-ee-17-native-image
      ```
      Confirm that the installed package size is correct by entering `yes` at the prompt.

## Update Oracle GraalVM

The `yum` package manager for Oracle Linux can be used to update an existing GraalVM installation or replace it with another version. 

1. To update GraalVM, for example, from version 21.x to 22.x, run:

   ```shell
   sudo yum install graalvm22-ee-17-jdk
   ```

2. Confirm that the installed package size is correct by entering `yes` at the prompt.
3. Check the Java version to confirm that the update was successful:

   ```shell
   java -version
   ```

The **graalvm22-ee-17-jdk** package is installed alongside **graalvm22-ee-17-jdk** in the _/usr/lib64/graalvm_ directory. Note that regardless the version printed to the console, the `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME` environment variables still point to the old version. Reset the variables as described in step 3.

### Note on `yum upgrade`

The `yum upgrade` command can be used to update on the same year package line, for example, to upgrade from Oracle GraalVM 22.3.1 to version 22.3.2 when this RPM package becomes available:

   ```shell
   sudo yum upgrade graalvm22-ee-17-jdk
   ```
   As there is no newer package available, you will see the `No packages marked for update` message.

It will update the whole system and remove any obsolete Oracle GraalVM installation.
