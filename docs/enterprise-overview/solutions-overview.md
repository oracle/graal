# Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition

## Challenges Today’s Businesses Face

Today’s online global enterprises and microservices alike face the same needs:
achieving better performance, and reducing ever-increasing infrastructure costs.
The evolution from older, layered architectures to microservices requires new,
innovative approaches to running a business either on premises or on the cloud.

Speed, dexterity, and leanness are key, then, to commanding the modern
online marketplace.

## Faster, Leaner Applications

GraalVM Enterprise is a foundation for innovation and improvement for both large
enterprise applications and microservices alike.

Built on trusted and secure Oracle Java SE, GraalVM Enterprise accelerates
application performance while consuming fewer resources — improving application
efficiency and reducing IT costs.

In data centers with ever-growing workloads, being able to service more
requests with the same computing infrastructure reduces the need to purchase
additional hardware. Thus GraalVM Enterprise’s reduction of required compute
resources can lower capital cost expenditures on premise and lower operation
costs on cloud.

GraalVM's key advantages:
* Innovative compiler
* Native Image technology
* Language interoperability
* Built on Oracle Java SE
* Trusted Oracle support and updates

### Innovative Compiler
GraalVM’s just-in-time (JIT) compiler accelerates the performance of any Java
or JVM-based application - out of the box and without any code changes.

Across the board, applications running on GraalVM Enterprise exhibit lower
latency. Request response times are reduced. Applications run faster, freeing up
CPU and memory sooner, allowing them to handle other requests or other
applications running on the same server.

### Native Image Technology
GraalVM Enterprise also incorporates its optimizing compiler into an
advanced ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation technology: Native Image. The industry-leading native
image builder translates Java and JVM-based applications into native platform
executables that enjoy incredibly fast startup times since the program initialization
is done at build time so, when tasked, the application is already compiled.

Utilizing Native Image, Java applications consume a fraction of the resources
they would if running on a JVM, making GraalVM Enterprise ideal for cloud
deployments large and small.

### Language Interoperability
GraalVM Enterprise breaks the barriers between programming languages.

Java is the most popular language for building enterprise applications but
JavaScript, Python, Ruby, R, and other programming languages have carved out niches
in specific areas, e.g., machine learning. Many have accompanying libraries that provide
unique and valuable features. Hence, developers often use different languages
for specialized applications.

GraalVM Enterprise provides high-performance runtime support for a number of
languages beyond Java, allowing different languages and
libraries to interoperate with no performance penalty. This improves developer
productivity by letting them use the right language or library for a given task.

Key to GraalVM Enterprise’s polyglot support is language compliance. For each of
the supported languages, GraalVM Enterprise strictly adheres to the
specification for each language and runs their compliance test suites to ensure
compatibility.

GraalVM Enterprise also tracks changes through Oracle’s participation in a
number of standards bodies like Ecma International. GraalVM innovations are in
turn influencing specifications, like the recent announcement of the OpenJDK’s
Project Leyden, which seeks to provide a standard specification for Java binary
executables pioneered by the Native Image technology.

### Trusted Oracle Support and Updates
GraalVM Enterprise customers take advantage of 24/7 access to the experienced GraalVM
Enterprise support team who work closely with the Oracle Java support team.

GraalVM Enterprise releases include all Oracle Java critical patch updates
(CPUs) which are released on a regular schedule to remedy defects and known
vulnerabilities.
