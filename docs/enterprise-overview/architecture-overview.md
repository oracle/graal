# Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition Architecture Overview

Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition (GraalVM Enterprise) is a highly productive JDK distribution.
It is designed to accelerate the execution of applications written in Java and other JVM languages while also providing a high-performance runtime for JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and a number of other popular languages.
GraalVM Enterprise's polyglot capabilities make it possible to mix multiple programming languages in a single application while eliminating any foreign language call costs.

This page provides developers, solution architects, and infrastructure architects with an architectural overview of GraalVM Enterprise, as well as information about runtime modes, supported platforms, available distributions, core and additional functionalities, and support levels for various features.
The conceptual overview and advantages of GraalVM Enterprise are described on the [Solutions Overview](solutions-overview.md) page.

## GraalVM Enterprise Architecture

*Figure 1. GraalVM Enterprise Runtime*

The preceding diagram illustrates a complete high-level architecture of GraalVM Enterprise.

GraalVM adds an [advanced just-in-time (JIT) optimizing compiler](../reference-manual/java/compiler.md), which is written in Java, to the HotSpot Java Virtual Machine.

In addition to running Java and JVM-based languages, [GraalVM's language implementation framework (Truffle)](../../truffle/docs/README.md), makes it possible to run JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and a number of other popular languages on the JVM.
With Truffle, Java and other supported languages can directly interoperate with each other and pass data back and forth in the same memory space.

## Runtime Modes

GraalVM Enterprise is unique as a runtime environment offering several modes of operation: JVM runtime mode, Native Image, Java on Truffle (the same Java applications can be run on either).

#### JVM Runtime Mode
When running programs on the HotSpot JVM, GraalVM defaults to the [Graal compiler](../reference-manual/java/compiler.md) as the top-tier JIT compiler.
At runtime, an application is loaded and executed normally on the JVM.
The JVM passes bytecodes for Java or any other JVM-native language to the compiler, which compiles that to the machine code and returns it to the JVM.
Interpreters for supported languages, written on top of the [Truffle framework](../../truffle/docs/README.md), are themselves Java programs that run on the JVM.

#### Native Image
[Native Image](../reference-manual/native-image/README.md) is an innovative technology that compiles Java code into a standalone binary executable or a native shared library.
The Java bytecode that is processed during the native image build includes all application classes, dependencies, third party dependent libraries, and any JDK classes that are required.
A generated self-contained native executable is specific to each individual operating systems and machine architecture that does not require a JVM.

#### Java on Truffle
[Java on Truffle](../reference-manual/java-on-truffle/README.md) is an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine Specification, built with the [Truffle framework](../../truffle/docs/README.md).
It is a complete Java VM that includes all core components, implements the same API as the Java Runtime Environment library, and reuses all JARs and native libraries from GraalVM.

## Available Distributions

GraalVM Enterprise distributions are based on Oracle JDK 11 and 17.
GraalVM Enterprise releases include all Oracle Java critical patch updates (CPUs), which are released on a regular schedule to remedy defects and known vulnerabilities.

GraalVM Enterprise is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms on x86 64-bit systems, and for Linux on ARM 64-bit system.
Depending on the platform, the distributions are shipped as *.tar.gz* or *.zip* archives.
