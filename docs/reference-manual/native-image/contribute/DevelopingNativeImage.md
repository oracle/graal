# The Substrate VM Project

Substrate VM is an internal project name for the technology behind [GraalVM Native Image](../README.md).
This guide shows how to set up a development environment for the project.

To get started, install [mx](https://github.com/graalvm/mx).
Then point the `JAVA_HOME` variable to a JDK that supports a compatible version
of the JVM Compiler Interface (JVMCI). JVMCI is a privileged, low-level interface
to the JVM that can read metadata from the VM, such as method bytecode, and
install machine code into the VM. Obtain JVMCI-enabled:
* JDK 8 from [GitHub](https://github.com/graalvm/openjdk8-jvmci-builder/releases)
* JDK 11 from [GitHub](https://github.com/graalvm/labs-openjdk-11/releases)

#### Prerequisites
For compilation, `native-image` depends on the local toolchain. Install
`glibc-devel`, `zlib-devel` (header files for the C library and `zlib`) and
`gcc`, using a package manager available on your OS. Some Linux distributions
may additionally require `libstdc++-static`.

On Windows, Native Image requires Visual Studio 2022 version 17.1.0 or later.

```shell
cd substratevm
mx build

echo "public class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(\"Hello World\"); } }" > HelloWorld.java
$JAVA_HOME/bin/javac HelloWorld.java
mx native-image HelloWorld
./helloworld
```

To build polyglot images, refer to the documentation in the [VM suite](../../../../vm/README.md).

## Build Native Image

Using Native Image in a development environment requires the `mx` tool to be installed first, so that it is on your `PATH`.
Visit the [MX Homepage](https://github.com/graalvm/mx) for more details.

In the main directory, invoke `mx help` to see the list of commands.
Most of the commands are inherited from the [Graal](https://github.com/oracle/graal) and [Truffle](https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/truffle) code bases.
More information on a specific command is available by running `mx help <command>`.
The most important commands are:

* `build`: compile all Java and native code
* `clean`: remove all compilation artifacts
* `ideinit`: create project files for Eclipse and other common IDEs
See the [documentation on IDE integration](../../../../compiler/docs/IDEs.md) for details.

## Build Native Executables

After running `mx build` you can use `mx native-image` to build native images.
You can specify the main entry point, i.e., the application you want to create the image for. For more information run `mx native-image --help`.

A native image generation is performed by a Java program, a Native Image builder, that runs on a JVMCI-enabled JDK. You can debug it with a regular Java debugger.
Use `mx native-image --debug-attach` to start native image generation so that it waits for a Java debugger to attach first (by default, at port 8000).
In Eclipse, use the debugging configuration _substratevm-localhost-8000_ to attach to it. This debugging configuration is automatically generated by `mx ideinit`.

If you have to debug the compiler graphs that are built as part of an image, proceed to the [debugging](../../../../compiler/docs/Debugging.md) page.
You can use the [Ideal Graph Visualizer (IGV)](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/tools/igv/) tool to view individual compilation steps:
```shell
mx igv &>/dev/null &
mx native-image HelloWorld -H:Dump= -H:MethodFilter=HelloWorld.*
```

## Options

More information about options and the important distinction between hosted and runtime options is available [here](../docs/reference-manual/native-image/BuildOptions.md).

## Project Structure

The list of projects is defined in a custom format in the file `mx.substratevm/suite.py`. It is never necessary to create new projects in the IDE.
Instead, a new project is created by adding it in `suite.py` and running `mx ideinit` to generate a corresponding IDE project.

## Code Formatting

Style rules and procedures for checking adherence are described in the [style guide](CodeStyle.md).

## Troubleshooting Eclipse

Sometimes, Eclipse gives strange error messages, especially after pulling a
bigger changeset. Also, projects are frequently added or removed, leading to
error messages about missing projects if you do not import new projects. The
following should reset everything:

* Delete all projects in Eclipse
* `mx clean`
* `mx ideclean`
* `mx fsckprojects`
* `mx build`
* `mx ideinit`
* Import all projects into Eclipse again

## Usage Documentation

The documentation on how to use Native Image is available [here](../README.md) or [on the website](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/).
