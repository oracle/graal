# Optimizations and Performance

Native Image provides different mechanisms that enable users to optimize a generated binary in terms of performance, file size, build time, debuggability, and other metrics.

### Optimization Levels

Similar to `gcc` and `clang`, users can control the optimization level using the `-O` option.
By default, `-O2` is used which aims for a good tradeoff between performance, file size, and build time.
The following table provides an overview of the different optimization levels and explains when they are useful:

| Level | Optimizations | Use Cases |
|:---:|:---:|---|
| `-Ob` | Reduced | Quick build mode: Speeds up builds during development by avoiding time-consuming optimizations. This can also reduce file size sometimes. |
| `-Os` | Reduced | Optimize for size: `-Os` enables all `-O2` optimizations except those that can increase code or image size significantly. Typically creates the smallest possible images at the cost of reduced performance. |
| `-O0` | None | Typically used together with `-g` to improve the debugging experience. |
| `-O1` | Basic | Trades performance for reduced file size and build time. Oracle GraalVM's `-O1` is somewhat comparable to `-O2` in GraalVM Community Edition. |
| `-O2` | Advanced | **Default:** Aims for good performance at a reasonable file size. |
| `-O3` | All | Aims for the best performance at the cost of longer build times. Used automatically by Oracle GraalVM for [PGO builds](guides/optimize-native-executable-with-pgo.md) (`--pgo` option). `-O3` and `-O2` are identical in GraalVM Community Edition. |

### Profile-Guided Optimizations for Improved Throughput

Consider using Profile-Guided Optimizations to optimize your application for improved throughput.
These optimizations allow the Graal compiler to leverage profiling information, similar to when it is running as a JIT compiler, when AOT-compiling your application.
For this, perform the following steps:

1. Build your application with `--pgo-instrument`.
2. Run your instrumented application with a representative workload to generate profiling information. Profiles collected from this run are stored by default in the _default.iprof_ file.
3. Rebuild your application with the `--pgo` option. You can pass a custom _.iprof_ file with `--pgo=<your>.iprof`, otherwise _default.iprof_ is used. This will rebuild your image and generate an optimized version of your application.

Find more information on this topic in [Basic Usage of Profile-Guided Optimization](../PGO-Basic-Usage.md).

### Optimizing for Specific Machines

Native Image provides a `-march` option that works similarly to the ones in `gcc` and `clang`: it enables users to control the set of instructions that the Graal compiler can use when compiling code to native.
By default, Native Image uses [`x86-64-v3` on x64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels){:target="_blank"} and [`armv8-a` on AArch64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family#Cores){:target="_blank"}.
Use `-march=list` to list all available machine types.
If the generated binary is built on the same or similar machine type that it is also deployed on, use `-march=native`.
This option instructs the compiler to use all instructions that it finds available on the machine the binary is generated on.
If the generated binary, on the other hand, is distributed to users with many different, and potentially very old machines, use `-march=compatibility`.
This reduces the set of instructions used by the compiler to a minimum and thus improves the compatibility of the generated binary.

### Additional Features

Native Image provides additional features to further optimize a generated binary:
- Choosing an appropriate Garbage Collector and tailoring the garbage collection policy can reduce GC times. See [Memory Management](MemoryManagement.md).
- Loading application configuration during the image build can speed up application startup. See [Class Initialization at Image Build Time](ClassInitialization.md).
- The build output may provide some other recommendations that help you get the best out of Native Image. See [Build Output: Recommendations](BuildOutput.md#recommendations).
