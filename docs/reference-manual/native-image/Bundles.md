# Native Image Bundles

Native Image provides a new experimental feature that allows users to build images from a self-contained _Native Image Bundle_.

In contrast to regular image building, this mode of operation only takes a single `*.nib`-file as an input argument that contains everything that is needed to build an image.
This can be useful when large applications consisting of many input-files (jar-files, configuration files, auto-generated files, downloaded files) need to be rebuilt at a later point in time without worrying that all files needed for building are still available.
Often complex builds involve downloading many libraries as part of building that are not guaranteed to remain accessible at a later point in time.
Using bundles is a safe solution to encapsulate all this input required for building into a single file.

## Creating Bundles

To create a bundle, it is sufficient to simply pass the `--bundle-create` option along with the all the other arguments for a specific `native-image` command line invocation.
This will cause `native-image` to create a `*.nib`-file in addition to the actual image.

```text
--bundle-create[=new-bundle.nib]
                      in addition to image building, create a Native Image bundle file (*.nib
                      file) that allows rebuilding of that image again at a later point. If a
                      bundle-file gets passed, the bundle will be created with the given
                      name. Otherwise, the bundle-file name is derived from the image name.
                      Note both bundle options can be combined with --dry-run to only perform
                      the bundle operations without any actual image building.
```

For example, assuming a Micronaut application should be built with Maven, we would want to make sure the `--bundle-create` option is used.
For that, the following needs to be added to the plugins section of `pom.xml`:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.graalvm.buildtools</groupId>
  <artifactId>native-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
      <buildArgs combine.children="append">
          <buildArg>--bundle-create</buildArg>
      </buildArgs>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

Now when `./mvnw package -Dpackaging=native-image` is used, we get the following Maven build output after a few minutes.

```text
Finished generating 'micronautguide' in 2m 0s.

Native Image Bundles: Bundle build output written to /home/testuser/micronaut-data-jdbc-repository-maven-java/target/micronautguide.output
Native Image Bundles: Bundle written to /home/testuser/micronaut-data-jdbc-repository-maven-java/target/micronautguide.nib

[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  02:08 min
[INFO] Finished at: 2023-03-27T15:09:36+02:00
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

This output indicates that we have in fact built a bundle as part of building with Maven.
This file resides in `target/micronautguide.nib`.
It should be copied away to some safe place where it will be found if this image needs to be rebuilt anytime later.
Obviously a bundle file can be large, because it contains all input files needed to rebuild the image as well as the built image itself.
Having the image inside the bundle allows comparing an image rebuilt from the bundle against the original one.
In the case of the `micronaut-data-jdbc-repository` example the bundle is 60.7 MB (the image is 103.4 MB, but it's compressed within the bundle).
To see what's inside a bundle we can use:
```text
$ jar tf micronautguide.nib
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
META-INF/nibundle.properties
output/default/micronautguide
input/classes/cp/micronaut-core-3.8.7.jar
input/classes/cp/netty-buffer-4.1.87.Final.jar
input/classes/cp/jackson-databind-2.14.1.jar
input/classes/cp/micronaut-context-3.8.7.jar
input/classes/cp/reactive-streams-1.0.4.jar
...
input/classes/cp/netty-handler-4.1.87.Final.jar
input/classes/cp/micronaut-jdbc-4.7.2.jar
input/classes/cp/jackson-core-2.14.0.jar
input/classes/cp/micronaut-runtime-3.8.7.jar
input/classes/cp/micronautguide-0.1.jar
input/stage/build.json
input/stage/environment.json
input/stage/path_substitutions.json
input/stage/path_canonicalizations.json
```
As we can see a bundle is just a jar-file with a specific layout.
This is explained in detail [below](#bundle-file-format).

Next to the bundle we can also find the output folder: `target/micronautguide.output`.
It contains the built image and any other files that were created as part of the image build.
Since we did not specify any options that would produce extra output (e.g. debuginfo, diagnostics output) only the image itself can be found there:
```text
$ tree target/micronautguide.output
target/micronautguide.output
├── default
│   └── micronautguide
└── other
```

### Combining --bundle-create with --dry-run

As mentioned in the option help text of `--bundle-create`, it is also possible to let `native-image` build a bundle but not actually perform the image build.
This might be useful if a user wants to move the bundle to a more powerful machine and build the image there.
If we modify the above `native-maven-plugin` configuration to also contain
```xml
<buildArg>--dry-run</buildArg>
```
then running `./mvnw package -Dpackaging=native-image` takes only seconds and the created bundle is much smaller:
```text
Native Image Bundles: Bundle written to /home/testuser/micronaut-data-jdbc-repository-maven-java/target/micronautguide.nib

[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  2.267 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2023-03-27T16:33:21+02:00
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Now `micronautguide.nib` is only 20 MB in file size and looking inside shows that the image (`output/default/micronautguide`) is not included:
```text
$ jar tf micronautguide.nib
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
META-INF/nibundle.properties
input/classes/cp/micronaut-core-3.8.7.jar
...
```
Note that this time we also do not see
```text
Native Image Bundles: Bundle build output written to /home/testuser/micronaut-data-jdbc-repository-maven-java/target/micronautguide.output
```
in the Maven output. Since no actual image got created, no bundle build output is available.

## Building with bundles

Let's assume that a previously built image is used in production and once in a while an unexpected exception is thrown at runtime.
Since we still have the bundle that was used to create that image, it is trivial to build a variant of that image with debugging support.
We use `--bundle-apply=micronautguide.nib` like this:

```text
$ native-image --bundle-apply=micronautguide.nib -g

Native Image Bundles: Loaded Bundle from /home/testuser/micronautguide.nib
Native Image Bundles: Bundle created at 'Tuesday, March 28, 2023, 11:12:04 AM Central European Summer Time'

========================================================================================================================
...
Finished generating 'micronautguide' in 2m 16s.

Native Image Bundles: Bundle build output written to /home/testuser/micronautguide.output
```

After running this command, the image is rebuilt with the extra option `-g` that was passed after `--bundle-apply`.
The output of this build is in directory `micronautguide.output`:
```text
micronautguide.output
micronautguide.output/other
micronautguide.output/default
micronautguide.output/default/micronautguide.debug
micronautguide.output/default/micronautguide
micronautguide.output/default/sources
micronautguide.output/default/sources/javax
micronautguide.output/default/sources/javax/smartcardio
micronautguide.output/default/sources/javax/smartcardio/TerminalFactory.java
...
micronautguide.output/default/sources/java/lang/Object.java
```

We successfully rebuilt the application from the bundle with debuginfo enabled.

The full option help text of `--bundle-apply` shows a more advanced uses-case that we will discuss [later](#combining---bundle-create-and---bundle-apply) in detail:
```text
--bundle-apply=some-bundle.nib
                      an image will be built from the given bundle file with the exact same
                      arguments and files that have been passed to native-image originally
                      to create the bundle. Note that if an extra --bundle-create gets passed
                      after --bundle-apply, a new bundle will be written based on the given
                      bundle args plus any additional arguments that haven been passed
                      afterwards. For example:
                      > native-image --bundle-apply=app.nib --bundle-create=app_dbg.nib -g
                      creates a new bundle app_dbg.nib based on the given app.nib bundle.
                      Both bundles are the same except the new one also uses the -g option.
```

## Capturing Environment Variables

Before bundle support was added, all environment variables from the environment the `native-image` tool was started in, were visible to the image builder.
This approach does not work well with bundles and is even problematic for image building without bundles.
Consider having an environment variable that holds sensitive information from your build machine.
Due to Native Image's ability to run code at image build time that can create data that will be available at image-runtime, it is very easy to build an image were you accidentally leak the contents of such variables into an image.

Passing environment variables to `native-image` now requires explicit arguments.

Suppose a user wants to use environment variable (e.g. `KEY_STORAGE_PATH`) from the environment the `native-image` tool is invoked, in the static constructor of a class that is set to be initialized-at-build-time.
To allow accessing the variable in the static constructor (with `java.lang.System.getenv`) option `-EKEY_STORAGE_PATH` needs to be passed to the builder.

More formally, to make an environment variable accessible to image build-time use:
```text
-E<env-var-key>[=<env-var-value>]
                      allow native-image to access the given environment variable during
                      image build. If the optional <env-var-value> is not given, the value
                      of the environment variable will be taken from the environment
                      native-image was invoked from.
```

Using `-E` works as expected with bundles.
Any environment variable specified with `-E` will be captured in the bundle.
For variables where the optional `<env-var-value>` is not given, the bundle will capture the value the variable had at the time the bundle was created.
Prefix `-E` was chosen tho make the option look similar to the related `-D<java-system-property-key>=<java-system-property-value>` option (which makes Java system properties available at image build-time).

## Combining --bundle-create and --bundle-apply

As already mentioned [before](#building-with-bundles), it is possible to create new bundles based on existing ones.
The `--bundle-apply` help text has a simple example.
A more interesting example arises if an existing bundle is used create a bundle that builds a PGO-optimized version of the original application.

Let's again use assume we already built the `micronaut-data-jdbc-repository` example into a bundle named `micronautguide.nib`.
To produce a PGO optimized variant of that bundle, we first have to build a variant of the image that generates PGO profiling information during image runtime that we can use later:

```text
$ native-image --bundle-apply=micronautguide.nib --pgo-instrument

```
Based on <a href="https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-data-jdbc-repository.html" target="_blank">this walkthrough</a>, we now use the running image to add new database entries and query the information in the database afterwards so that we get real-world profiling information.
Once completed, we shut the Micronaut application down with `CTRL-C` (`SIGTERM`).
Looking into the current working directory we can now find a new file:
```text
$ ls -lh  *.iprof
-rw------- 1 testuser testuser 19M Mar 28 14:52 default.iprof
```
The file `default.iprof` contains the profiling information that was created because we ran the Micronaut application as an image that was built with `--pgo-instrument`.
Now we have what we need to create a new optimized bundle out of the existing one:
```text
native-image --bundle-apply=micronautguide.nib --bundle-create=micronautguide-pgo-optimized.nib --dry-run --pgo

Native Image Bundles: Loaded Bundle from /home/testuser/micronautguide.nib
Native Image Bundles: Bundle created at 'Tuesday, March 28, 2023, 11:12:04 AM Central European Summer Time'

Warning: Native Image Bundles are an experimental feature.
Native Image Bundles: Bundle written to /home/testuser/micronautguide-pgo-optimized.nib
```
Let's take a look how `micronautguide-pgo-optimized.nib` is different from `micronautguide.nib`:
```text
$ ls -lh *.nib
-rw-r--r-- 1 testuser testuser  20M Mar 28 11:12 micronautguide.nib
-rw-r--r-- 1 testuser testuser  23M Mar 28 15:02 micronautguide-pgo-optimized.nib
```
We see that the new bundle is 3 MB larger than the existing one.
The reason, as can easily be guessed, is that now the bundle also contains the `default.iprof` file.
Using a tool to compare folders we inspect the differences in detail:

![visual-bundle-compare](visual-bundle-compare.png)

As we can see `micronautguide-pgo-optimized.nib` indeed contains `default.iprof` in folder `input/auxiliary` and there
are also changes in other files. The contents of `META-INF/nibundle.properties`, `input/stage/path_substitutions.json`
and `input/stage/path_canonicalizations.json` will be explained [later](#bundle-file-format). For now, we just look at the diff in
`build.json`:
```text
@@ -4,5 +4,6 @@
   "--no-fallback",
   "-H:Name=micronautguide",
   "-H:Class=example.micronaut.Application",
-  "--no-fallback"
+  "--no-fallback",
+  "--pgo"
 ]
```
As expected, the new bundle contains the `--pgo` option that we passed to the `native-image` command line we used to build the optimized bundle.
Building an image from this new bundle generates a pgo-optimized image out of the box (see `PGO: on` in build output):
```text

## Bundle file format

A bundle-file is a jar-file with a well-defined internal layout.
Inside a bundle we can find the following inner structure:
```text
[bundle-file.nib]
├── META-INF
│   ├── MANIFEST.MF
│   └── nibundle.properties <- Contains build bundle version info:
│                              * Bundle format version (BundleFileVersion{Major,Minor})
│                              * Platform and architecture the bundle was created on 
│                              * GraalVM / Native-image version used for bundle creation
├── input <- All information required to rebuild the image
│   ├── auxiliary <- Contains auxiliary files passed to native-image via arguments
│   │                (e.g. external `config-*.json` files or PGO `*.iprof`-files)
│   ├── classes   <- Contains all class-path and module-path entries passed to the builder
│   │   ├── cp
│   │   └── p
│   └── stage
│       ├── build.json          <- Full native-image command line (minus --bundle options)
│       ├── environment.json              <- Environment variables used in the image build
│       ├── path_canonicalizations.json  <- Record of path-canonicalizations that happened
│       │                                       during bundle creation for the input files  
│       └── path_substitutions.json          <- Record of path-substitutions that happened
│                                               during bundle creation for the input files
└── output
    ├── default
    │   ├── myimage         <- Created image and other output created by the image builder 
    │   ├── myimage.debug
    |   └── sources
    └── other      <- Other output created by the builder (not relative to image location)
```
### META-INF
The layout of a bundle file itself is versioned.
In `META-INF/nibundle.properties` there are two properties that declare which version of the layout a given bundle-file is based on.
At the time of writing this document, bundles use the following layout version:
```text
BundleFileVersionMajor=0
BundleFileVersionMinor=9
```
Future versions of GraalVM might alter or extend the internal structure of bundle files.
The versioning allows to evolve the bundle format with backwards compatibility in mind.

### input

This directory contains all input data that gets passed to the image builder to perform the build.
File `input/stage/build.json` holds the original command line that was passed to the `native-image` tool when the bundle was created.
Parameters that make no sense to get reapplied in a bundle-build are already filtered out.
These include:
* `--bundle-{create,apply}`
* `--verbose`
* `--dry-run`

The state of environment variables that are relevant for the image build are captured in `input/stage/environment.json`.
For every `-E` argument that has been seen when the bundle was created, a snapshot of its key-value pair is recorded in the file.
This ensures that an image-rebuild from the bundle will see the same environment variables as the original build.
The remaining files `path_canonicalizations.json` and `path_substitutions.json` contain a record of the file-path transformations that have been performed by the `native-image` tool based on the input file paths as specified by the original command line arguments.

### output

If an image got built as part of building the bundle (i.e. `--dry-run` option was not used) we also have an `output` folder in the bundle.
It contains the image that got built along with any other files that were generated as part of building the image.
Most output files are located in `output/default` (e.g. the image, its debug-info and debug-sources).
Builder output files that would have been written to arbitrary absolute paths if the image had not been built in bundle-mode can be found in `output/other`.
