# Build a Native Shared Library

To build a native shared library, pass the command-line argument `--shared` to the `native-image` tool, as follows

```shell
native-image <class name> --shared
```

To build a native shared library from a JAR file, use the following syntax:
```shell
native-image -jar <jarfile> --shared
```

The resulting native shared library will have the `main()` method of the given Java class as its **entrypoint** method.

If your library doesn't include a `main()` method, use the `-H:Name=` command-line option to specify the library name, as follows:

```shell
native-image --shared -H:Name=<libraryname> <class name>
native-image --shared -jar <jarfile> -H:Name=<libraryname>
```

GraalVM makes it easy to use C to call into a native shared library. 
There are two primary mechanisms for calling a method (function) embedded in a native shared library: the [Native Image C API](../C-API.md) and the [JNI Invocation API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/jni/invocation.html).

This guide describes how to use the **Native Image C API**. It consists of the following steps:
1. Create and compile a Java class library containing at least one **entrypoint** method.
2. Use the `native-image` tool to create a shared library from the Java class library.
3. Create and compile a C application that calls an **entrypoint** method in the shared library.

### Tips and Tricks

The shared library must have at least one **entrypoint** method.
By default, only a method named `main()`, originating from a `public static void main()` method, is identified as an **entrypoint** and callable from a C application.

To export any other Java method:

* Declare the method as static.
* Annotate the method with `@CEntryPoint` (`org.graalvm.nativeimage.c.function.CEntryPoint`).
* Make one of the method's parameters of type `IsolateThread` or `Isolate`, for example, the first parameter (`org.graalvm.nativeimage.IsolateThread`) in the method below. This parameter provides the current thread's execution context for the call.
* Restrict your parameter and return types to non-object types. These are Java primitive types including pointers, from the `org.graalvm.nativeimage.c.type` package.
* Provide a unique name for the method. If you give two exposed methods the same name, the `native-image` builder will fail with the `duplicate symbol` message. If you do not specify the name in the annotation, you must provide the `-H:Name=libraryName` flag at build time.

Below is an example of an **entrypoint** method:

```java
@CEntryPoint(name = "function_name")
static int add(IsolateThread thread, int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

When the `native-image` tool builds a native shared library, it also generates a C header file.
The header file contains declarations for the [Native Image C API](../C-API.md) (which enables you to create isolates and attach threads from C code) as well as declarations for each **entrypoint** in the shared library.
The `native-image` tool generates a C header file containing the following C declaration for the example above:
```c
int add(graal_isolatethread_t* thread, int a, int b);
```

A native shared library can have an unlimited number of **entrypoints**, for example to implement callbacks or APIs.

### Run a Demo

In the following example, you'll create a small Java class library (containing one class), use `native-image` to create a shared library from the class library, and then create a small C application that uses the shared library.
The C application takes a string as its argument, passes it to the shared library, and prints environment variables that contain the argument.

1. Make sure you have installed a GraalVM JDK.
The easiest way to get started is with [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/jdks#graal).
For other installation options, visit the [Downloads section](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/).

2. Then install the LLVM toolchain: 
    ```bash
    gu install llvm-toolchain
    ```
    > Note: The llvm-toolchain GraalVM component is not available on Microsoft Windows.

3. Save the following Java code to a file named _LibEnvMap.java_:

    ```java
    import java.util.Map;
    import org.graalvm.nativeimage.IsolateThread;
    import org.graalvm.nativeimage.c.function.CEntryPoint;
    import org.graalvm.nativeimage.c.type.CCharPointer;
    import org.graalvm.nativeimage.c.type.CTypeConversion;

    public class LibEnvMap {
        //NOTE: this class has no main() method

        @CEntryPoint(name = "filter_env")
        private static int filterEnv(IsolateThread thread, CCharPointer cFilter) {
            String filter = CTypeConversion.toJavaString(cFilter);
            Map<String, String> env = System.getenv();
            int count = 0;
            for (String envName : env.keySet()) {
                if(!envName.contains(filter)) continue;
                System.out.format("%s=%s%n",
                                envName,
                                env.get(envName));
                count++;
            }
            return count;
        }
    }
    ```
    Notice how the method `filterEnv()` is identified as an **entrypoint** using the `@CEntryPoint` annotation and the method is given a name as a argument to the annotation. 

4. Compile the Java code and build a native shared library, as follows:
    ```shell
    $JAVA_HOME/bin/javac LibEnvMap.java
    ```
    ```shell
    $JAVA_HOME/bin/native-image -H:Name=libenvmap --shared 
    ```

    It will produce the following artifacts:
    ```
    --------------------------------------------------
    Produced artifacts:
    /demo/libenvmap.dylib (shared_lib)
    /demo/libenvmap.h (header)
    /demo/graal_isolate.h (header)
    /demo/libenvmap_dynamic.h (header)
    /demo/graal_isolate_dynamic.h (header)
    /demo/libenvmap.build_artifacts.txt
    ==================================================
    ```

    If you work with C or C++, use these header files directly. For other languages, such as Java, use the function declarations in the headers to set up your foreign call bindings. 

5. Create a C application, _main.c_, in the same directory containing the following code:

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>

    #include "libenvmap.h"

    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <filter>\n", argv[0]);
        exit(1);
    }

    graal_isolate_t *isolate = NULL;
    graal_isolatethread_t *thread = NULL;

    if (graal_create_isolate(NULL, &isolate, &thread) != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "initialization error\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("Number of entries: %d\n", filter_env(thread, argv[1]));

    graal_tear_down_isolate(thread);
    }
    ```
    
    The statement `#include "libenvmap.h"` loads the native shared library.


6. Compile the C application using `clang`. 
    ```shell
    $JAVA_HOME/languages/llvm/native/bin/clang -I ./ -L ./ -l envmap -Wl,-rpath ./ -o main main.c 
    ```

7. Run the C application by passing a string as an argument. For example:
    ```shell
    ./main USER
    ```
    It will correctly print out the name and value of the matching environment variable(s). 
    
The advantage of using the Native Image C API is that you can determine what your API will look like. 
The restriction is that your parameter and return types must be non-object types.
If you want to manage Java objects from C, you should consider [JNI Invocation API](../JNI.md).
