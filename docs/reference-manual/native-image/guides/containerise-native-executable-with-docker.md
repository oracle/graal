# Containerise a Native Executable and Run in a Docker Container

Docker containers provide the flexibility of development environments to match a production environment, to help isolate your application, and to minimize overhead. For self-contained executables, generated with GraalVM Native Image, containers are an obvious deployment scenario.

To support container-based development, there are several GraalVM container images available, depending on the platform, the architecture, the Java version, and the edition:

- Oracle GraalVM container images can be found in the [Oracle Container Registry](https://container-registry.oracle.com/ords/f?p=113:10::::::)
- GraalVM Community Edition container images can be found in the [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/orgs/graalvm/packages)

This guide shows how to containerise a Java application with Docker on macOS. 
You will use `ghcr.io/graalvm/jdk:ol8-java17` which is a size compact GraalVM Community container image with the GraalVM JDK pre-installed. 
The Dockerfile will be provided.

### Prerequisites

-  Docker-API compatible container runtime like [Rancher Desktop](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/getting-started/installation/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/) installed to run MySQL and to run tests using [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org). 

## Note on a Sample Application

For the demo you will use the [Spring Boot 3 Native Image Microservice example](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-demos/blob/master/spring-native-image/README.md). 

1. Make sure you have installed a GraalVM JDK.
The easiest way to get started is with [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/jdks#graal).
For other installation options, visit the [Downloads section](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/).

2. Clone the [GraalVM Demos repository](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-demos) and enter the application directory:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-demos
    ```
    ```shell
    cd spring-native-image
    ```

3. Build a native executable and run the application:

    ```shell
    mvn -Pnative native:compile
    ```
    The `-Pnative` profile is used to turn on building a native executable with Maven.
    
    This will create a binary executable `target/benchmark-jibber`. Start it to see the application running:

    ```shell
    ./target/benchmark-jibber &
    curl http://localhost:8080/jibber
    fg
    ```

Now that you have a native executable version of the sample application (`target/jibber`) and seen it working, you can proceed to the next steps.

## Containerise a Native Executable

The output of a native executable is platform-dependent.
If you use a Mac or Windows, to build a Docker image containing your native executable, you build a native executable **within** a Docker container - so you need a container with a JDK distribution.
If you are a Linux user, you can just pass a native executable to Docker and use the simplest slim or distroless container, depending on static libraries your application is linked against. 
For example:

```
FROM gcr.io/distroless/base
ARG APP_FILE
EXPOSE 8080
COPY target/${APP_FILE} app 
ENTRYPOINT ["/jibber"]
```

For user's convenience, Dockerfiles are provided with the sample application. 

1. From application root folder, run this command to create a native executable within a container and then build a Docker image containing that native executable:
    ```shell
    docker build -f Dockerfiles/Dockerfile \
                --build-arg APP_FILE=./target/jibber \
                -t localhost/jibber:native.01 .
    ```
    It will take several minutes to set up Maven in the container and do rest of the job.

2. Query Docker to look at your newly built image:
    ```shell
    docker images | head -n2
    ```
    You should see a new image listed.

3. Run the image as follows:
    ```shell
    docker run --rm --name native -d -p 8080:8080 localhost/jibber:native.01 
    ```
    
4. Then call the endpoint using the `curl` command in the same console window:
    ```shell
    curl http://localhost:8080/jibber
    ```
    You should receive a nonsense verse in the style of the poem Jabberwocky. 
    
    
You can take a look at how long the application took to startup by looking at the logs:

```shell
docker logs <CONTAINER ID>
```
You can also query Docker to get the size of the produced container:
```
docker images localhost/jibber:native.01
```
The difference will be more visible if you build a Docker image of the same Spring Boot application containing a JAR file instead of a native executable, and compare images startup times and file sizes. 
    
On Linux, you can shrink your container size even more.
With GraalVM Native Image you have the ability to build a statically linked native executable by packaging the native executable directly into an empty Docker image, also known as a scratch container.
