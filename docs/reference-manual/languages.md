# Languages References

GraalVM is designed to accelerate the execution of applications written in Java and other JVM languages while also providing a high performance runtime for JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and a number of other popular languages.
GraalVM's polyglot capabilities make it possible to mix multiple programming languages in a single application while eliminating any foreign language call costs.
