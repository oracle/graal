GraalVM Updater, `gu`, is a command-line tool for installing and managing optional GraalVM language runtimes and utilities. 
It is available in the GraalVM JDK.
To assist you with the installation, language runtimes and utilities are pre-packaged as JAR files and referenced in the documentation as "components".
GraalVM Updater can be also used to update your local GraalVM installation to a newer version or upgrade from GraalVM Community Edition to Oracle GraalVM.
Read more in [Upgrade GraalVM](#graalvm-updater-commands-overview).

## Check Available Components

To check what components are already shipped with your GraalVM installation or what you have already installed, run the `list` command:
```shell
gu list
```

To check what components are available for your GraalVM version to install, run the `gu available` command:
```shell
gu available
Downloading: Component catalog from ...
ComponentId              Version            Component name                
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
espresso                 <version>          Java on Truffle               
espresso-llvm            <version>          Java on Truffle LLVM Java library
js                       <version>          JavaScript
llvm                     <version>          LLVM
llvm-toolchain           <version>          LLVM.org toolchain                  
nodejs                   <version>          Graal.nodejs                  
python                   <version>          Graal.Python                  
R                        <version>          FastR                         
ruby                     <version>          TruffleRuby                   
wasm                     <version>          GraalWasm                     
```

Note down the `ComponentId` value for the component you would like to install.

GraalVM Updater verifies whether or not the version of a component is appropriate for your current GraalVM installation. 
A component may require other components as prerequisites for its operation.
GraalVM Updater verifies such requirements and will either attempt to download the required dependencies, or abort the installation if the component's requirements are not met.
Components intended for Oracle GraalVM cannot be installed on GraalVM Community Edition.

Generic support for Node.js, R, Ruby, Python, and WebAssembly will work out of the box in most cases.
It is recommended to fine-tune system-dependent configurations, following the recommendations in the component post-installation messages.

## Install Components

You can install a component **by component's ID** using GraalVM Updater: `gu install ComponentId`.

1. Get a list of components available for your GraalVM version and their descriptive names:
    ```shell
    gu available
    ```
2. Install a component package using the `ComponentId` value. For example, `js`:
    ```shell
    gu install js
    ```
    The installation starts, displaying progress.

To see more verbose output during the installation, as the download progress bar, print versions, and dependency information, use the `-v` (`--verbose`) switch.

If a component is installed that depends on another component, GraalVM Updater will search for the appropriate dependency and install it as well.
If a required component cannot be found, the installation will fail.

## Install Components Manually

You can install a component **from a local file**, in other words, manually.

1. Download a component in consideration of the operating system, the Java version, and architecture (if applicable) from:

    - [Oracle GraalVM Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/downloads/graalvm-downloads.html) for Oracle GraalVM
    - [GitHub](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases/) for GraalVM Community Edition

2. Having downloaded the appropriate JAR file, install it with this command:

    ```shell
    gu -L install component.jar
    ```
    The `-L` option, equivalent to `--local-file` or `--file`, installs a component from a downloaded JAR.
    However, a component may depend on other components (e.g., Ruby depends on the LLVM toolchain).
    For example, `gu -L install component.jar` will fail if the required components are not yet installed.
    If all dependencies are downloaded into the same directory, you can run:

    ```shell
    gu -L install -D
    ```

## Install Components from Local Collection

Components can be downloaded manually in advance to a local file folder, or to a folder shared on the local network.
GraalVM Updater can then use that folder instead of the catalog. 
Specify the directory to use for the components collection:
```shell
gu install -C /path/to/downloads/directory ComponentId
```

## Uninstall Components

Components may be uninstalled from GraalVM when no longer needed.
To uninstall a specific component, use its `ComponentId`. Run `gu list` to find out the exact `ComponentId`.

The command to uninstall the component is:
```shell
gu remove ComponentId
```

If more components end with, for example, `ruby`, the installer will print an error message that a component’s full name is required (`org.graalvm.ruby`).

Note that the LLVM toolchain component may fail uninstallation if its dependent component(s) remains installed. In this case, remove the dependent component first, or add the `-D` option, which would remove dependent components in addition to those explicitly selected:
```shell
gu -D remove llvm-toolchain
```

## Rebuild Images

Language runtime components for GraalVM may change. For example:
- polyglot native libraries become out of sync;
- removed languages runtimes may cause the native binary to fail on missing resources or libraries.

To rebuild and refresh the native binaries (language launchers), use the following command:
```shell
gu rebuild-images [--verbose] polyglot|libpolyglot|js|llvm|python|ruby|R... [custom native-image args]...
```

## Replace Components and Files

A component may be only installed once. 
GraalVM Updater refuses to install a component if a component with the same ID is already installed.
However, the installed component can be replaced. 
GraalVM Updater first uninstalls the component, and then installs a new one.

To replace a component, use the `-r` option and the `-L` (`--local-file` or `--file`) option to treat parameters as the local filename of a packaged component:
```shell
gu install -L -r component.jar
gu install -r ruby
```

The process is the same as if `gu remove` is run first and `gu install` next.

GraalVM Updater also refuses to overwrite existing files if the to-be-installed and existing versions differ.
There are cases when refreshing file contents may be needed, such as if they were modified or damaged.
In this case, use the `-o` option:
```shell
gu install -L -o component.jar
gu install -o ruby
```

GraalVM Updater will then instruct the user to replace the contained files of a component.
By default, it will not alter anything. 
Alternatively, use the `-f` (`--force`) option, which disables most of the checks and allows the user to install non-matching versions.

## Configure Proxies

If GraalVM Updater needs to reach the component catalog, or download a component, it may need to pass through the HTTP/HTTPS proxy, if the network uses one.
On macOS, the proxy settings are automatically obtained from the OS.
On Linux, ensure that the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` environment variables are set appropriately before launching the `gu` tool.
Refer to the distribution and/or desktop environment documentation for the details.

GraalVM Updater intentionally does not support an option to disable certificate or hostname verification, for security reasons.
A user may try to add a proxy's certificate to the GraalVM default security trust store.
You can also download a component manually to a directory, and then run `gu -L install /path/to/file` to install from a local filesystem (see [Install Components Manually](#install-components-manually)).

### Working without Internet Access

If your machine cannot access and download the catalog and components from the Internet, GraalVM Updater can install components from a local directory, or a directory on an accessible network share.

You need to prepare a directory, download all components that you want to install and their dependencies (in case they require other GraalVM components to work) into that directory.

Then you can use `gu -L install /path/to/file` (where the `-L` option instructs to use local files, equivalent to `--local-file` or `--file`).
Adding the `-D` option will instruct GraalVM Updater to look for potential dependencies in the directory next to the installable file.
Additionally, `gu -C /path/to/download/dir install component` can be used, with the specified directory contents acting as a catalog of components.

Note that with `gu -L` you need to specify the component's file name, but when using `gu -C <dir>`, you need to specify a component ID (`ComponentId`):
```shell
# Specify file location
gu -LD install /tmp/installables/ruby.jar

# Specify component name
gu -C /tmp/instalables install ruby
```

## Configure Installation

The installation command of GraalVM Updater accepts multiple options and parameters:
    ```shell
    gu install [-0CcDfiLMnosruvyxY] param [param ...]
    ```

* `-C, --custom-catalog <url>`: use a specific catalog URL to locate components
* `-L, --local-file`: treat parameters as local filenames of packaged components
* `-M`: force `gu` to ignore dependencies of installed components
* `-f, --force`: force overwrite, bypass version checks
* `-i, --fail-existing`: fail on an existing component
* `-n, --no-progress`: do not display the downloading progress
* `-o, --overwrite`: overwrite different files
* `-r, --replace`: replace existing components
