# GraalVM Debugging and Monitoring Tools

GraalVM provides a set of tools for developers to debug and monitor deployed applications, as well as the GraalVM platform, itself.
Traditional tools may not be ready to diagnose polyglot programs.
GraalVM tools, however, are implemented to inspect single or multi-language applications by debugging via numerous clients, profiling, statement counting, dynamic analysis, and much more.
