/**
 * Wrapper class for annotation access that defends against
 * https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-7183985: when an annotation declares a Class<?> array
 * parameter and one of the referenced classes is not present on the classpath parsing the
 * annotations will result in an ArrayStoreException instead of caching of a
 * TypeNotPresentExceptionProxy. This is a problem in JDK8 but was fixed in JDK11+. This wrapper
 * class also defends against incomplete class path issues. If the element for which annotations are
 * queried is a JMVCI value, i.e., a HotSpotResolvedJavaField, or HotSpotResolvedJavaMethod, the
 * annotations are read via HotSpotJDKReflection using the
 * getFieldAnnotation()/getMethodAnnotation() methods which first construct the field/method object
 * via CompilerToVM.asReflectionField()/CompilerToVM.asReflectionExecutable() which eagerly try to
 * resolve the types referenced in the element signature. If a field declared type or a method
 * return type is missing then JVMCI throws a NoClassDefFoundError.
