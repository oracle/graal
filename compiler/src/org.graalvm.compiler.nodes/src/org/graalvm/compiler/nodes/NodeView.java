/**
 * Interface that overrides properties of a node, such as the node's stamp.
 *
 * This interface allows richer canonicalizations when the current compilation context can provide a
 * narrower stamp than the one stored in the node itself. One such example is performing
 * canonicalization late in the compilation, when the nodes are already scheduled, and benefit from
 * additional stamp information from conditional checks in branches.
 *
 * For example, in the following code, <code>offset + i</code> can be canonicalized once it is
 * scheduled into the branch:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public void update(int offset, int i) {
 *     if (i == 0) {
 *         array[offset + i];
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
