/**
 * When Graal {@link ValueNode} classes implement interfaces, it is frequently necessary to convert
 * from an interface type back to a Node. This could be easily done using a cast, but casts come
 * with a run time cost. Using a conversion method, which is implemented once on
 * {@link ValueNode#asNode()}, avoids a cast. But it is faster only as long as the implementation
 * method can be inlined. Therefore, it is important that only one implementation of the interface
 * method exists, so that either single-implementor speculation (for JIT compilation) or static
 * analysis results (for AOT compilation) allow the one implementation to be inlined.
 *
 * Subinterfaces like {@link FixedNodeInterface} provide a conversion method that has a more precise
 * return type. Note that these sub-interfaces use a different method name like
 * {@link FixedNodeInterface#asFixedNode()}, which then have another single implementation without a
 * cast in {@link FixedNode#asFixedNode()}.

     * This method is called `asNode` and not `asValueNode` partly for historic reasons, because
     * originally the interface was called just `NodeInterface`. But since there are so many
     * callers, we also want to keep the call sites as short as possible.
