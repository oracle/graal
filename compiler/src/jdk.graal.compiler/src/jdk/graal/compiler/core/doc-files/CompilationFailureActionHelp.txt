Specifies the action to take when compilation fails.

The accepted values are:
    Silent  - Prints nothing to the console.
     Print  - Prints the stack trace to the console.
  Diagnose* - Retries the compilation with extra diagnostics.
    ExitVM  - Same as Diagnose except that the VM process exits after retrying.
    
* If the value is "Diagnose", compilation is retried with extra diagnostics enabled including dumping.
  Options specific to retry compilations can be modified using the DiagnoseOptions meta-option.
  For example, to enable full debug dumping and logging during all retry compilations, use "-Djdk.graal.DiagnoseOptions=Dump=:5 Log=:5".
  If the option value starts with a non-word character, that character is used as the separator between options instead of a space.
  For example: "-Djdk.graal.DiagnoseOptions=@Log=Inlining@LogFile=/path/with space".
