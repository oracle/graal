Specifies the action to take when compilation fails.

The accepted values are:
    Silent  - Print nothing to the console.
     Print  - Print a stack trace to the console.
  Diagnose* - Retry the compilation with extra diagnostics.
    ExitVM  - Same as Diagnose except that the VM process exits after retrying.
    
* If "Diagnose" is set compilation will be retried with extra diagnostics enabled including dumping (see file:doc-files/DumpHelp.txt). 
  In such a scenario DiagnoseDumpLevel can be used to specify the dump level (DebugContext dump levels) accordingly.
