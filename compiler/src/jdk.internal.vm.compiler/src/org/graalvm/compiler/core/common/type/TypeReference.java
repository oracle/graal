/**
 * This class represents a reference to a Java type and whether this reference is referring only to
 * the represented type or also to its sub types in the class hierarchy. When creating a type
 * reference, the following options have to be considered:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The reference should always only refer to the given concrete type. Use
 * {@link #createExactTrusted(ResolvedJavaType)} for this purpose.</li>
 * <li>The reference should be created without assumptions about the class hierarchy. The returned
 * reference is exact only when the type is a leaf type (i.e., it cannot have subclasses). Depending
 * on whether interface types can be trusted for this type reference use
 * {@link #createWithoutAssumptions} or {@link #createTrustedWithoutAssumptions}.</li>
 * <li>The reference should be created using assumptions about the class hierarchy. The returned
 * reference is also exact, when there is only a single concrete sub type for the given type.
 * Depending on whether interface types can be trusted for this type reference use {@link #create}
 * or {@link #createTrusted}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * For the methods with untrusted interface types, a {@code null} reference will be constructed for
 * untrusted interface types. Examples for interface types that cannot be trusted are types for
 * parameters, fields, and return values. They are not checked by the Java verifier.
