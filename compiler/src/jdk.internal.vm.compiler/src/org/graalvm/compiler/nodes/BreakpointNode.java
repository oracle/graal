/**
 * A node that results in a platform-dependent breakpoint instruction being emitted. A number of
 * arguments can be associated with such a node for placing values of interest in the Java ABI
 * specified parameter locations corresponding to the kinds of the values. That is, the arguments
 * are set up as if the breakpoint instruction was a call to a compiled Java method.
 * <p>
 * A breakpoint is usually placed by defining a node intrinsic method as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     {@literal @}NodeIntrinsic(BreakpointNode.class)
 *     static native void breakpoint(Object object, Word mark, Word value);
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that the signature is arbitrary. Its sole purpose is to capture values you may want to
 * inspect in the native debugger when the breakpoint is hit. These values are placed in the
 * parameter registers (see the platform-specific {@link jdk.vm.ci.code.RegisterConfig}). In gdb,
 * these registers can be inspected using (for instance):
 *
 * <pre>
 *     (gdb) info registers
 *     (gdb) pp @($rdi)
 * </pre>
