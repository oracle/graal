/**
 * vzeroupper is essential to avoid performance penalty during SSE-AVX transition. Specifically,
 * once we have executed instructions that modify the upper bits (i.e., 128+) of the YMM registers,
 * we need to perform vzeroupper to transit the state to 128bits before executing any SSE
 * instructions. We don't need to place vzeroupper between VEX-encoded SSE instructions and legacy
 * SSE instructions, nor between AVX instructions and VEX-encoded SSE instructions.
 *
 * When running Graal on HotSpot, we emit a vzeroupper LIR operation (i.e. an instance of this
 * class) before a foreign call to the runtime function where Graal has no knowledge. The underlying
 * reason is that HotSpot is SSE-compiled so as to support older CPUs. We also emit a vzeroupper
 * instruction (see {@code AMD64HotSpotReturnOp.emitCode}) upon returning, if the current LIR graph
 * contains LIR operations that touch the upper bits of the YMM registers, including but not limited
 * to {@link AMD64VectorInstruction}, {@link AMD64ArrayCompareToOp}, {@link AMD64ArrayEqualsOp},
 * {@link AMD64ArrayIndexOfOp}, and {@link ForeignCallOp} that invokes to Graal-compiled stubs. For
 * the last case, since Graal-compiled stubs is under our control, we don't emit vzeroupper upon
 * returning of the stub, but rather do that upon returning of the current method.
 *
 * On JDK8, C2 does not emit many vzeroupper instructions, potentially because that YMM registers
 * are not heavily employed (C2 vectorization starts using YMM registers in 9, source
 * https://cr.openjdk.java.net/~vlivanov/talks/2017_Vectorization_in_HotSpot_JVM.pdf) and thus less
 * care has been taken to place these instructions. One example is that many intrinsics employ YMM
 * registers starting from https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8005419, but does not properly
 * place vzeroupper upon returning of the intrinsic stub or the caller of the stub.
 *
 * Most vzeroupper were added in JDK 10 (https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8178811), and was
 * later restricted on Haswell Xeon due to performance regression
 * (https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8190934). The actual condition for placing vzeroupper
 * is at http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk/file/c7d9df2e470c/src/hotspot/cpu/x86/x86_64.ad#l428. To
 * summarize, if nmethod employs YMM registers (or intrinsics which use them, search for
 * clear_upper_avx() in opto/library_call.cpp) vzeroupper will be generated on nmethod's exit and
 * before any calls in nmethod, because even compiled nmethods can still use only SSE instructions.
 *
 * This means, if a Java method performs a call to an intrinsic that employs YMM registers,
 * C2-compiled code will place a vzeroupper before the call, upon exit of the stub and upon exit of
 * this method. Graal will only place the last, because it ensures that Graal-compiled Java method
 * and stubs will be consistent on using VEX-encoding.
 *
 * In SubstrateVM, since the whole image is compiled consistently with or without VEX encoding (the
 * later is the default behavior, see {@code NativeImageGenerator.createTarget}), there is no need
 * for vzeroupper. For dynamic compilation on a SubstrateVM image, if the image is SSE-compiled, we
 * then need vzeroupper when returning from the dynamic compiled code to the pre-built image code.
