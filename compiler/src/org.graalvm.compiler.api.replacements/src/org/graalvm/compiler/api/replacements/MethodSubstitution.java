/**
 * Denotes a method whose body is used by a compiler as the substitute (or intrinsification) of
 * another method. The exact mechanism used to do the substitution is compiler dependent but every
 * compiler should require substitute methods to be annotated with {@link MethodSubstitution}.
 *
 * A compiler may support partial intrinsification where only a part of a method is implemented by
 * the compiler. The unsupported path is expressed by a call to either the original or substitute
 * method from within the substitute method. Such as call is a <i>partial intrinsic exit</i>.
 *
 * For example, here's a HotSpot specific intrinsic for {@link Array#newInstance(Class, int)} that
 * only handles the case where the VM representation of the array class to be instantiated already
 * exists:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;MethodSubstitution
 * public static Object newInstance(Class<?> componentType, int length) {
 *     if (componentType == null || loadKlassFromObject(componentType, arrayKlassOffset(INJECTED_VMCONFIG), CLASS_ARRAY_KLASS_LOCATION).isNull()) {
 *         // Array class not yet created - exit the intrinsic and call the original method
 *         return newInstance(componentType, length);
 *     }
 *     return DynamicNewArrayNode.newArray(GraalDirectives.guardingNonNull(componentType), length, JavaKind.Object);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Here's the same intrinsification where the exit is expressed as a call to the original method:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;MethodSubstitution
 * public static Object newInstance(Class<?> componentType, int length) {
 *     if (componentType == null || loadKlassFromObject(componentType, arrayKlassOffset(INJECTED_VMCONFIG), CLASS_ARRAY_KLASS_LOCATION).isNull()) {
 *         // Array class not yet created - exit the intrinsic and call the original method
 *         return java.lang.reflect.newInstance(componentType, length);
 *     }
 *     return DynamicNewArrayNode.newArray(GraalDirectives.guardingNonNull(componentType), length, JavaKind.Object);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * A condition for a partial intrinsic exit is that it is uses the unmodified parameters of the
 * substitute as arguments to the partial intrinsic exit call. There must also be no side effecting
 * instruction between the start of the substitute method and the partial intrinsic exit.
