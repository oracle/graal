/**
 * The information required for high level code generation of a foreign call. A foreign call differs
 * from a normal compiled Java call in at least one of these aspects:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The call is to C/C++/assembler code.</li>
 * <li>The call uses different conventions for passing parameters or returning values.</li>
 * <li>The callee has different register saving semantics. For example, the callee may save all
 * registers (apart from some specified temporaries) in which case the register allocator doesn't
 * not need to spill all live registers around the call site.</li>
 * <li>The call does not occur at an INVOKE* bytecode. Such a call could be transformed into a
 * standard Java call if the foreign routine is a normal Java method and the runtime supports
 * linking Java calls at arbitrary bytecodes.</li>
