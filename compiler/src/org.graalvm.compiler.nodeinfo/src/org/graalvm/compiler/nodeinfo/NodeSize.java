/**
 * Constants representing the abstract number of CPU instructions needed to represent a node. This
 * ignores byte sizes of instructions (i.e., 32/64/variable-length).
 *
 * Note that the sizes specified are only estimations and should only be used to enhance performance
 * of generated code. They should not be used to change any semantics of nodes.
 *
 * If a specific node has vastly different sizes based on different CPUs or how it might be
 * potentially lowered (e.g., 1 versus 100 instructions), it should override
 * {@code Node.estimatedNodeSize()}. Otherwise, just use the average of the different values (e.g.,
 * if AMD64 size is 5 and AArch64 is 1, use 3).
 *
 * In general, the current sizes for nodes are based on domain knowledge and experience, including
 * machine-learning based tweaking. When adding a new node, it's best to look at the cost model for
 * similar nodes if unsure what values to specify. Benchmarking is also useful to tune model
 * parameters.
