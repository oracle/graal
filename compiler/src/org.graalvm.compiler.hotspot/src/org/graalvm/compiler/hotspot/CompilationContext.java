/**
 * A context for scoping the lifetime of foreign objects.
 *
 * The need for this mechanism is best explained with an example. When folding a GETFIELD bytecode
 * denoting a {@code final static} non-primitive field, libgraal can create a {@link JavaConstant}
 * wrapping a handle to the field's value in the HotSpot heap. This handle must be released before
 * HotSpot can reclaim the object it references. Performing a compilation in the scope of a
 * {@linkplain HotSpotGraalServices#openLocalCompilationContext local} context ensures the handle is
 * released once the compilation completes, allowing the HotSpot GC to subsequently reclaim the
 * HotSpot object. When libgraal creates data structures that outlive a single compilation and may
 * contain foreign object references (e.g. snippet graphs), it must enter the
 * {@linkplain HotSpotGraalServices#enterGlobalCompilationContext global} context. Foreign object
 * handles created in the global context are only released once their {@link JavaConstant} wrappers
 * are reclaimed by the libgraal GC.
 *
 * {@link CompilationContext}s have no impact on {@link JavaConstant}s that do not encapsulate a
 * foreign object reference.
 *
 * The object returned by {@link HotSpotGraalServices#enterGlobalCompilationContext} or
 * {@link HotSpotGraalServices#openLocalCompilationContext} should be used in a try-with-resources
 * statement. Failure to close a context will almost certainly result in foreign objects being
 * leaked.
