 * {@link AbstractBlockBase}. However, direct references are not possible since the control flow
 * graph (and therefore successors lists) can be changed by optimizations - and fixing the
 * instructions is error prone. Therefore, we represent an edge to block B from block A via the
 * tuple {@code (A,
 * successor-index-of-B)}. That is, indirectly by storing the index into the successor list of A.
 * Note therefore that the successor list cannot be re-ordered.
